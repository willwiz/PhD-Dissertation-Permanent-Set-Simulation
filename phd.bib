  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Heart valves control unidirectional blood flow within the heart during the cardiac cycle. They have a remarkable ability to withstand the demanding mechanical environment of the heart, achieving lifetime durability by processes involving the ongoing remodeling of the extracellular matrix. The focus of this review is on heart valve functional physiology, with insights into the link between disease-induced alterations in valve geometry, tissue stress, and the subsequent cell mechanobiological responses and tissue remodeling. We begin with an overview of the fundamentals of heart valve physiology and the characteristics and functions of valve interstitial cells (VICs). We then provide an overview of current experimental and computational approaches that connect VIC mechanobiological response to organ- and tissue-level deformations and improve our understanding of the underlying functional physiology of heart valves. We conclude with a summary of future trends and offer an outlook for the future of heart valve mechanobiology, specifically, multiscale modeling approaches, and the potential directions and possible challenges of research development. © 2016 American Physiological Society.

  abstract     = {Alteration of the native mitral valve (MV) shape has been hypothesized to have a profound effect on the local tissue stress distribution, and is potentially linked to limitations in repair durability. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the relation between MV annular shape and central mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) strain history, using flat annuloplasty in an ovine model. In addition, we report for the first time the presence of residual in vivo leaflet strains. In vivo leaflet deformations were measured using sonocrystal transducers sutured to the MVAL (n = 10), with the 3D positions acquired over the full cardiac cycle. In six animals a flat ring was sutured to the annulus and the transducer positions recorded, while in the remaining four the MV was excised from the exsanguinated heart and the stress-free transducer positions obtained. In the central region of the MVAL the peak stretch values, referenced to the minimum left ventricular pressure (LVP), were 1.10 +/- 0.01 and 1.31 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard error) in the circumferential and radial directions, respectively. Following flat ring annuloplasty, the central MVAL contracted 28\% circumferentially and elongated 16\% radially at minimum LVP, and the circumferential direction was under a negative strain state during the entire cardiac cycle. After valve excision from the exsanguinated heart, the MVAL contracted significantly (18 and 30\% in the circumferential and radial directions, respectively), indicating the presence of substantial in vivo residual strains. While the physiological function of the residual strains (and their associated stresses) are at present unknown, accounting for their presence is clearly necessary for accurate computational simulations of MV function. Moreover, we demonstrated that changes in annular geometry dramatically alter valvular functional strains in vivo. As levels of homeostatic strains are related to tissue remodeling and homeostasis, our results suggest that surgically introduced alterations in MV shape could lead to the long term MV mechanobiological and microstructural alterations that could ultimately affect MV repair durability.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Application of annuloplasty rings during mitral valve (MV) repair has been shown to significantly change the mitral annular geometry. Until recently, a comprehensive two-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation of annular geometric changes was difficult owing to its nonplanar orientation. In this study, an analysis of the three-dimensional intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation of the MV annulus is presented before and immediately after repair. METHODS: We performed three-dimensional geometric analysis on 75 patients undergoing MV repair during coronary artery bypass graft surgery for mitral regurgitation or myxomatous mitral valve disease. Geometric analysis of the MV was performed before and immediately after valve repair with full rings and annuloplasty bands. The acquired three-dimensional volumetric data were analyzed in the operating room. Specific measurements included annular diameter, leaflet lengths, the nonplanarity angle, and the circularity index. Before and after repair data were compared. RESULTS: Complete echocardiographic assessment of the MV was feasible in 69 of 75 patients (92\%) within 2 to 3 minutes of acquisition. Placement of full rings resulted in an increase in the nonplanarity angle or a less saddle shape of the native mitral annulus (137 +/- 14 versus 146 +/- 14; p = 0.002. By contrast, the nonplanarity angle did not change significantly after placement of partial rings. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral annular nonplanarity can be assessed in the operating room. Application of full annuloplasty rings resulted in the mitral annulus becoming more planar. Partial annuloplasty bands did not significantly change the nonplanarity angle. Neither of the two types of rings restored the native annular planarity.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: Mitral valve repair for degenerative diseases has shown suboptimal results in selected patients. Improved postinterventional mitral valve mechanics are essential to increase repair durability. METHODS: Eight porcine mitral valves were tested in a physiologic left heart simulator under normal hemodynamic conditions. Leaflet strain was measured by tracking the displacement of a 5 x 8 marker array located on the central region of the anterior leaflet. Local leaflet strain and strain rates were calculated from measured displacements. The experiments were conducted in 4 different annular configurations associated with saddle height/commissural diameter ratios of 0\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 30\%. All experiments were conducted in the normal papillary muscle position. RESULTS: For all annular configurations, the anterior leaflet material showed anisotropy, with the major principal strain in the radial direction and the minor principal strain in the circumferential direction. The peak major principal strain was 0.22 +/- 0.07, whereas the peak minor principal strain was 0.11 +/- 0.049 in the normal annular configuration (saddle height/commissural diameter ratio of 20\%). The peak major principal strain was reduced by 13.52\% +/- 12.79\%, 27.53\% +/- 13.65\%, and 29.72\% +/- 29.79\% for the 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% saddle height/commissural diameter ratio configurations, respectively, when compared with reduction for the flat annular configuration. Peak strain in the circumferential direction was unaffected by annular curvature. Reduction in areal strain of 18.62\% +/- 18.98\% and 27.97\% +/- 35.01\% were observed for the 20\% and 30\% saddle height/commissural diameter ratio configurations, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strain in the central region of the anterior leaflet is reduced with increasing annular saddle curvature. Decreased leaflet strain and associated stress might improve mitral valve repair durability.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional saddle shape of the mitral annulus is well characterized in animals and humans, but the impact of annular nonplanarity on valve function or mechanics is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of the saddle shaped mitral annulus on the mechanics of the P2 segment of the posterior mitral leaflet. METHODS: Eight porcine mitral valves (n = 8) were studied in an in-vitro left heart simulator with an adjustable annulus that could be changed from flat to different degrees of saddle. Miniature markers were placed on the atrial face of the posterior leaflet, and leaflet strains at 0\%, 10\%, and 20\% saddle were measured using dual-camera stereophotogrammetry. Averaged areal strain and the principal strain components are reported. RESULTS: Peak areal strain magnitude decreased significantly from flat to 20\% saddle annulus, with a 78\% reduction in the measured strain over the entire P2 region. In the radial direction (annulus free edge), a 44.4\% reduction in strain was measured, whereas in the circumferential direction (commissure-commissure), a 34\% reduction was measured from flat to 20\% saddle. CONCLUSIONS: Nonplanar shape of the mitral annulus significantly reduced the mechanical strains on the posterior leaflet during systolic valve closure. Reduction in strain in both the radial and circumferential directions may reduce loading on the suture lines and potentially improve repair durability, and also inhibit progression of valve degeneration in patients with myxomatous valve disease.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Surgical techniques have been developed for mitral valve repair for a wide range of pathologies. However, excessive tissue stress and damage have been identified as etiologic factors limiting long-term durability. Before computational models to optimize valve repair can be realistically developed, in-vivo dynamic mitral valve leaflet strain data are required. However, these data do not presently exist. In the present study, a sheep model and sonomicrometry were used to compute the in-surface Eulerian strain tensor of the anterior leaflet over the cardiac cycle at varying afterloads. METHODS: The anterior leaflet of nine Dorsett sheep (35 kg to 45 kg) was instrumented with nine 1-mm hemispherical piezoelectric transducers in a 15-mm square array. Three-dimensional crystal spatial positions were recorded at 250 Hz over several cardiac cycles, with peak left ventricular pressures varying from 90 mm Hg to 200 mm Hg. The in-surface Eulerian strain tensor was computed from the crystal displacements. RESULTS: The mitral valve anterior leaflet experiences large anisotropic strains and peak strain rates of 400\%/s, followed by an absolute cessation of any deformation during systole. Increasing left ventricular pressure also increased the effective leaflet stiffness but not the peak strains. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first data on the dynamic in-vivo strain tensor of a functioning mitral valve anterior leaflet, which indicated large anisotropic strains and very high strain rates. Our observations also suggest that changes in left ventricular pressure and annular geometry result in altered effective leaflet stiffness, and may be an important factor in reducing leaflet stress and as such potentially affect mitral valve repair longevity.},

Heart J. 145(6):1058-1062, 2003], studies suggest that altering MV stress states may have an effect on tissue homeostasis, which could impact the long-term outcome [Accola, K. D., et al. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 79(4):1276-1283, 2005; Fasol, R., et al. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 77(6):1985-1988, 2004; Flameng, W., P. Herijgers, and K. Bogaerts. Circulation 107(12):1609-1613, 2003; Gillinov, A. M., et al. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 69(3):717-721, 2000]. Improved computational modeling that incorporates structural and geometrical data as well as cellular components has the potential to predict such changes; however, the absence of important boundary condition information limits current efforts. In this study, novel high definition in vivo annular kinematic data collected from surgically implanted sonocrystals in sheep was fit to a contiguous 3D spline based on quintic-order hermite shape functions with C(2) continuity. From the interpolated displacements, the annular axial strain and strain rate, bending, and twist along the entire annulus were calculated over the cardiac cycle. Axial strain was shown to be regionally and temporally variant with minimum and maximum values of -10 and 4\%, respectively, observed. Similarly, regionally and temporally variant strain rate values, up to 100\%/s contraction and 120\%/s elongation, were observed. Both annular bend and twist data showed little deviation from unity with limited regional variations, indicating that most of the energy for deformation was associated with annular axial strain. The regionally and temporally variant strain/strain rate behavior of the annulus are related to the varied fibrous-muscle structure and contractile behavior of the annulus and surrounding ventricular structures, although specific details are still unavailable. With the high resolution shape and displacement information described in this work, high fidelity boundary conditions can be prescribed in future MV finite element models, leading to new insights into MV function and strategies for repair.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Durability assessment of mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence is actually limited to reoperation as the primary indicator, with valve-related risk factors for late death as a secondary indicator. We assessed serial echocardiographic follow-up of valve function as an indicator of the durability of mitral valve repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 242 patients who had undergone mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence, echocardiographic follow-up of valve function, rate of reoperation, survival, and clinical outcome was studied. At 8 years after repair, clinical outcome was excellent, survival was 90.9+/-3.2\%, freedom from reoperation was 94.2+/-2.3\%, and freedom from anticoagulation bleeding and thromboembolic events was 90.4+/-2.7\%. However, freedom from non-trivial mitral regurgitation ({\textgreater}1/4) was 94.3+/-1.6\% at 1 month, 58.6+/-4.9\% at 5 years, and 27.2+/-8.6\% at 7 years. Freedom from severe mitral regurgitation ({\textgreater}2/4) was 98.3+/-0.9\% at 1 month, 82.8+/-3.8\% at 5 years and 71.1+/-7.4\% at 7 years. The linearized recurrence rate of non-trivial mitral regurgitation ({\textgreater}1/4) was 8.3\% per year and of severe mitral regurgitation ({\textgreater}2/4) was 3.7\% per year. Inadequate surgical techniques (chordal shortening, no use of annuloplasty ring or sliding plasty) could only partially explain recurrence of regurgitation. In selected patients who did not have these risk factors, linearized recurrence rates were 6.9\% per year and 2.5\% per year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The durability of a successful mitral reconstruction for degenerative mitral valve disease is not constant, and this should be taken into account when asymptomatic patients are offered early mitral valve repair.},

  abstract     = {There is growing evidence that heart valves are not passive structures but can remodel with left ventricular dysfunction. To determine if these tissues remodel under nonpathological conditions, we examined the mirtal valve anterior leaflet during the volume loading and cardiac expansion of pregnancy using a bovine model. We measured leaflet dimensions, chordal attachments, and biaxial mechanical properties of leaflets collected from never-pregnant heifers and pregnant cows (pregnancy duration estimated from fetal length). Hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) tests were performed to assess the denaturation temperature (T(d)) associated with collagen molecular stability and the load decay half-time (t(1//2)) associated with intermolecular cross-linking. Histological changes were examined using Verhoeff-van Gieson and picrosirius red staining with polarized light. We observed striking changes to the structure and material properties of the mitral anterior leaflet during pregnancy. Leaflet area was increased 33\%, with a surprising increase (nearly 25\%) in chordae tendinae attachments. There was a biphasic change in leaflet extensibility: it rapidly decreased by 30\% and then reversed to prepregnant values by late pregnancy. The 2 degrees C decrease in T(d) in pregnancy was indicative of collagen remodeling, whereas the 70\% increase in HIT t(1/2) indicated an increase in collagen cross-linking. Finally, histological results suggested transient increases in leaflet thickness and transient decreases in collagen crimp. This remodeling may compensate for the increased loading conditions associated with pregnancy by normalizing leaflet stress and maintaining coaptation. Understanding the mechanisms of mitral valve physiological remodeling in pregnancy could contribute to alternative treatments of pathological remodeling associated with left ventricular dysfunction.},

In many tendons these molecules pack in crystalline arrays and a careful measurement of the positions of the Bragg reflections allows the unit cell to be determined with high precision. From a further analysis of the X-ray data it can be shown that the highly ordered overlap region of the collagen fibrils consists of a crystalline array of molecular segments inclined by a small angle with respect to the fibril axis. In contrast, the gap region is less well ordered and contains molecular segments that are likely to be inclined by a similar angle but in a different vertical plane to that found in the overlap region. The collagen molecule thus has a D-periodic crimp in addition to the macroscopic crimp observed visually in the collagen fibres of many connective tissues. The growth and development of collagen fibrils have been studied by electron microscopy for a diverse range of connective tissues and the general pattern of fibril growth has been established as a function of age. In particular, relationships between fibril size distribution, the content and composition of the glycosaminoglycans in the matrix and the mechanical role played by the fibrils in the tissue have been formulated and these now seem capable of explaining many new facets of connective tissue structure and function.},

This review focuses on the distribution and function of various collagen types in different tissues. It introduces their basic structural subunits and points out major steps in the biosynthesis and supramolecular processing of fibrillar collagens as prototypical members of this protein family. A final outlook indicates the importance of different collagen types not only for the understanding of collagen-related diseases, but also as a basis for the therapeutical use of members of this protein family discussed in other chapters of this issue.},

  abstract     = {Tension-induced structural changes in bovine Achilles tendon collagen at each level of the hierarchy structure were investigated by means of the X-ray diffraction method. In order to estimate the straining mechanism in a collagen fibril, three elementary models for molecular elongation and rearrangement of collagen fibril were proposed on the basis of the Hodge-Petruska model: [1] molecular elongation, [2] increase in gap region and [3] relative slippage of laterally adjoining molecules. The characteristic 67 nm D-period of a collagen fibril increases with applied force. A Hookean-type force-strain curve was obtained for the D-period while the force-strain relation for the tendon was non-Hookean. The relative intensity of third-order reflection of the D-period to that of the second-order one, I3/I2, decreased with the applied force. This decrease in I3/I2 indicates a decrease in the ratio of the overlap region of collagen fibril to the D- period, O/D, which was analyzed on the basis of the Hodge-Petruska model. Decomposition of the observed strain in the D-period, epsilon(D), into these three deforming modes revealed that the major contribution to epsilon(D) originated from mode [1], molecular elongation. It was deduced that a fibril is mechanically composed of molecules connected serially to each other.},

  abstract     = {We have recently demonstrated that the mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) exhibited minimal hysteresis, no strain rate sensitivity, stress relaxation but not creep (Grashow et al., 2006, Ann Biomed Eng., 34(2), pp. 315-325; Grashow et al., 2006, Ann Biomed. Eng., 34(10), pp. 1509-1518). However, the underlying structural basis for this unique quasi-elastic mechanical behavior is presently unknown. As collagen is the major structural component of the MVAL, we investigated the relation between collagen fibril kinematics (rotation and stretch) and tissue-level mechanical properties in the MVAL under biaxial loading using small angle X-ray scattering. A novel device was developed and utilized to perform simultaneous measurements of tissue level forces and strain under a planar biaxial loading state. Collagen fibril D-period strain (epsilonD) and the fibrillar angular distribution were measured under equibiaxial tension, creep, and stress relaxation to a peak tension of 90 N/m. Results indicated that, under equibiaxial tension, collagen fibril straining did not initiate until the end of the nonlinear region of the tissue-level stress-strain curve. At higher tissue tension levels, epsilonD increased linearly with increasing tension. Changes in the angular distribution of the collagen fibrils mainly occurred in the tissue toe region. Using epsilonD, the tangent modulus of collagen fibrils was estimated to be 95.5+/-25.5 MPa, which was approximately 27 times higher than the tissue tensile tangent modulus of 3.58+/-1.83 MPa. In creep tests performed at 90 N/m equibiaxial tension for 60 min, both tissue strain and epsilonD remained constant with no observable changes over the test length. In contrast, in stress relaxation tests performed for 90 min epsilonD was found to rapidly decrease in the first 10 min followed by a slower decay rate for the remainder of the test. Using a single exponential model, the time constant for the reduction in collagen fibril strain was 8.3 min, which was smaller than the tissue-level stress relaxation time constants of 22.0 and 16.9 min in the circumferential and radial directions, respectively. Moreover, there was no change in the fibril angular distribution under both creep and stress relaxation over the test period. Our results suggest that (1) the MVAL collagen fibrils do not exhibit intrinsic viscoelastic behavior, (2) tissue relaxation results from the removal of stress from the fibrils, possibly by a slipping mechanism modulated by noncollagenous components (e.g. proteoglycans), and (3) the lack of creep but the occurrence of stress relaxation suggests a "load-locking" behavior under maintained loading conditions. These unique mechanical characteristics are likely necessary for normal valvular function.},

  abstract     = {Collagen, a molecule consisting of three braided protein helices, is the primary building block of many biological tissues including bone, tendon, cartilage, and skin. Staggered arrays of collagen molecules form fibrils, which arrange into higher-ordered structures such as fibers and fascicles. Because collagen plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of these tissues, significant theoretical research is directed toward developing models of the stiffness, strength, and toughness of collagen molecules and fibrils. Experimental data to guide the development of these models, however, are sparse and limited to small strain response. Using a microelectromechanical systems platform to test partially hydrated collagen fibrils under uniaxial tension, we obtained quantitative, reproducible mechanical measurements of the stress-strain curve of type I collagen fibrils, with diameters ranging from 150–470 nm. The fibrils showed a small strain (ɛ {\textless} 0.09) modulus of 0.86 ± 0.45 GPa. Fibrils tested to strains as high as 100\% demonstrated strain softening (σyield = 0.22 ± 0.14 GPa; ɛyield = 0.21 ± 0.13) and strain hardening, time-dependent recoverable residual strain, dehydration-induced embrittlement, and susceptibility to cyclic fatigue. The results suggest that the stress-strain behavior of collagen fibrils is dictated by global characteristic dimensions as well as internal structure.},

Mechanical properties of 125 μm-diameter extruded fibers (tangent modulus of 359.6±28.4 MPa; peak stress of 36.0±5.4 MPa) were similar to properties reported for human ligaments. Scaffolds of extruded fibers did not exhibit viscoelastic creep properties similar to natural ligaments. Collagen fibers from rat tail tendon (a well-studied comparison material) displayed characteristic strain-softening behavior, and scaffolds of rat tail fibers demonstrated a non-intuitive relationship between tangent modulus and specimen length. Composite scaffolds (extruded collagen fibers cast within a gel of Type I rat tail tendon collagen) were maintained with and without fibroblasts under standard culture conditions for 25 days; cell-incorporated scaffolds displayed significantly higher tangent moduli and peak stresses than those without cells.

  abstract     = {Heart valves (HVs) are fluidic control components of the heart that ensure unidirectional blood flow during the cardiac cycle. However, this description does not adequately describe the biomechanical ramifications of their function in that their mechanics are multi-modal. Moreover, they must replicate their cyclic function over an entire lifetime, with an estimated total functional demand of least 3x10(9) cycles. The focus of the present review is on the functional biomechanics of heart valves. Thus, the focus of the present review is on functional biomechanics, referring primarily to biosolid as well as several key biofluid mechanical aspects underlying heart valve physiological function. Specifically, we refer to the mechanical behaviors of the extracellular matrix structural proteins, underlying cellular function, and their integrated relation to the major aspects of valvular hemodynamic function. While we focus on the work from the author's laboratories, relevant works of other investigators have been included whenever appropriate. We conclude with a summary of important future trends.},

Starting from the initial hypothesis that elastin conformation is conditioned by that of its monomer, the structure of tropoelastin was first described using theoretical and experimental methods and a beta class folding type was evidenced for the isolated unbound tropoelastin molecules. The structure of elastin in the solid state was consistent with that of its monomer and consequently, fibrous elastin appeared constituted of globular tropoelastin molecules. Finally, theoretical and experimental considerations have led us to the conclusion that the functional form of the elastomer, water swollen elastin, could be a triphasic system comprising the protein chains, hydration water and solvent water. Following this description, the dynamic structural equilibria occurring within elastin hydrophobic domains and the plasticizing effect of water could explain elastin elasticity, in keeping with a classical entropic mechanism.},

The potential for such buckling to cause damage in new-generation pericardial valves, however, has not been examined. METHODS: Clinical-grade bovine pericardium fixed in 0.625\% glutaraldehyde was cut into 5 mm-wide strips. Fresh porcine aortic valve leaflets were fixed flat in 0.625\% glutaraldehyde and 5 mm-wide circumferential strips were cut. These tissues were bent to various curvatures, held bent with sutures, histologically processed, and sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the specimens were acquired by computer and the depth of compressive buckling, thickness of the specimen, and local curvature were measured. RESULTS: Porcine tissue showed a progressive increase in depth of buckling as both thickness and curvature increased, while bovine pericardium had minimal buckling at all curvatures. Porcine tissues buckled to a mean (+/- SEM) fractional depth of 0.23+/-0.012 while bovine pericardium buckled to only 0.09+/-0.006. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the internal fibrous structure of bovine pericardium may tolerate high bending curvatures better than porcine aortic valve leaflets when stiffened and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. This may explain the apparently good durability of current generation pericardial valves.},

Total amounts of collagen, proteoglycan and elastin were increased approx. 3-fold in floppy and rheumatic valves. The water content of rheumatic cusps was lower than normal. The most significant changes in floppy valves were the 59\% increase in mean value of the proteoglycan content, a large increase in the ease of extractability of proteoglycans from 26.7 to 57.2\% of the total and a 62\% increase in mean value of the elastin content in the anterior cusps. Normal human mitral valve cusps contained a mean proportion of 29.3 (and chordae 26.6) type III collagen (as \% of total types III + I collagen), the values increasing significantly to 33.2 and 36.3\% respectively in chronic rheumatic disease. The ratio observed in floppy valves depended on the extent of secondary surface fibrosis, which could be demonstrated histologically; in valve cusps with considerable secondary fibrosis, the percentage of type III increased significantly (to 34.4\%), whereas it decreased significantly (to 25.2\%) when fibrosis was negligible. It is concluded that the ratio of collagen types in floppy valves reflects the extent of secondary fibrosis rather than the pathogenesis of the disrupted collagen in the central core of the valve.},

  abstract     = {All existing constitutive models for heart valve leaflet tissues either assume a uniform transmural stress distribution or utilize a membrane tension formulation. Both approaches ignore layer specific mechanical contributions and the implicit nonuniformity of the transmural stress distribution. To begin to address these limitations, we conducted novel studies to quantify the biaxial mechanical behavior of the two structurally distinct, load bearing aortic valve (AV) leaflet layers: the fibrosa and ventricularis. Strip biaxial tests, with extremely sensitive force sensing capabilities, were further utilized to determine the mechanical behavior of the separated ventricularis layer at very low stress levels. Results indicated that both layers exhibited very different nonlinear, highly anisotropic mechanical behaviors. While the leaflet tissue mechanical response was dominated by the fibrosa layer, the ventricularis contributed double the amount of the fibrosa to the total radial tension and experienced four times the stress level. The strip biaxial test results further indicated that the ventricularis exhibited substantial anisotropic mechanical properties at very low stress levels. This result suggested that for all strain levels, the ventricularis layer is dominated by circumferentially oriented collagen fibers, and the initial loading phase of this layer cannot be modeled as an isotropic material. Histological-based thickness measurements indicated that the fibrosa and ventricularis constitute 41\% and 29\% of the total layer thickness, respectively. Moreover, the extensive network of interlayer connections and identical strains under biaxial loading in the intact state suggests that these layers are tightly bonded. In addition to advancing our knowledge of the subtle but important mechanical properties of the AV leaflet, this study provided a comprehensive database required for the development of a true 3D stress constitutive model for the native AV leaflet.},

However, very little is known about the fate of GAGs within the extracellular matrix of BHVs and their contribution to BHV longevity. BHVs used in heart valve replacement surgery have limited durability due to mechanical failure and pathologic calcification. In the present study we bring evidence for the dramatic loss of GAGs from within the BHV cusp structure during storage in saline and both short- and long-term Glut fixation. In order to gain insight into role of GAGs, we compared properties of fresh and Glut-fixed porcine heart valve cusps before and after complete GAG removal. GAG removal resulted in significant morphological and functional tissue alterations, including decreases in cuspal thickness, reduction of water content and diminution of rehydration capacity. By virtue of this diminished hydration, loss of GAGs also greatly increased the “with-curvature” flexural rigidity of cuspal tissue. However, removal of GAGs did not alter calcification potential of BHV cups when implanted in the rat subdermal model. Controlling the extent of pre-implantation GAG degradation in BHVs and development of improved GAG crosslinking techniques are expected to improve the mechanical durability of future cardiovascular bioprostheses.},

In the present study, we investigated the biomechanical role of GAGs in porcine aortic valve (AV) leaflets under tension utilizing enzymatic removal. Tissue specimens were removed from the belly region of porcine AVs and subsequently treated with either an enzyme solution for GAG removal or a control (buffer with no enzyme) solution. A dual stress level test methodology was used to determine the effects at low and high (physiological) stress levels. In addition, planar biaxial tests were conducted both on-axis (i.e. aligned to the circumferential and radial axes) and at 45 degrees off-axis to induce maximum shear, to explore the effects of augmented fiber rotations on the fiber-fiber interactions. Changes in hysteresis were used as the primary metric of GAG functional assessment. A simulation of the low-force experimental setup was also conducted to clarify the internal stress system and provide viscoelastic model parameters for this loading range. Results indicated that under planar tension the removal of GAGs had no measureable affect extensional mechanical properties (either on- or 45 degrees off-axis), including peak stretch, hysteresis and creep. Interestingly, in the low-force range, hysteresis was markedly reduced, from 35.96+/-2.65\% in control group to 25.00+/-1.64\% (p{\textless}0.001) as a result of GAG removal. Collectively, these results suggest that GAGs do not play a direct role in modulating the time-dependent tensile properties of valvular tissues. Rather, they appear to be strongly connected with fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions at low force levels. Thus, we speculate that GAGs may be important in providing a damping mechanism to reduce leaflet flutter when the leaflet is not under high tensile stress.},

  abstract   = {Accurate modeling of arterial elasticity is imperative for predicting pulsatile blood flow and transport to the periphery, and for evaluating the mechanical microenvironment of the vessel wall. The goal of the present study is to compare a recently developed structural model of porcine left anterior descending artery media to two commonly used typical representatives of phenomenological and structure-motivated invariant-based models, in terms of the number of model parameters, model descriptive and predictive powers, and requisite different test protocols for reliable parameter estimation. The three models were compared against 3D data of radial inflation, axial extension, and twist tests. Also checked are the models predictive capabilities to response data not used for estimation, including both tests outside the range of estimation database, as well as protocols of a different nature. The results show that the descriptive estimation error (model fit to estimation database), measured by the sum of squared residuals (SSE) between full 3D data and model predictions, was about twice as low for the structural (4.58\%) model compared to the other two (9.71 and 8.99\% for the phenomenological and structure-motivated models, respectively). Similar SSE ratios were obtained for the predictive capabilities. Prediction SSE at high stretch based on estimation of two low stretches yielded an SSE value of 2.81\% for the structural model, and 10.54\% and 7.87\% for the phenomenological and structure-motivated models, respectively. For the prediction of twist from inflation-extension data, SSE values for the torsional stiffness was 1.76\% for the structural model and 39.62 and 2.77\% for the phenomenological and structure-motivated models. The required number of model parameters for the structural model is four, whereas the phenomenological model requires six to nine and the structure-motivated has four parameters. These results suggest that modeling based on the tissue structural features improves model reliability in describing given data and in predicting the tissue general response.},

  abstract   = {Biological tissues have unique mechanical properties due to the wavy fibrous collagen and elastin microstructure. In inflation, a vessel easily distends under low pressure but becomes stiffer when the fibers are straightened to take up the load. The current microstructural models of blood vessels assume affine deformation; i.e., the deformation of each fiber is assumed to be identical to the macroscopic deformation of the tissue. This uniform-field (UF) assumption leads to the macroscopic (or effective) strain energy of the tissue that is the volumetric sum of the contributions of the tissue components. Here, a micromechanics-based constitutive model of fibrous tissue is developed to remove the affine assumption and to take into consideration the heterogeneous interactions between the fibers and the ground substance. The development is based on the framework of a recently developed second-order homogenization theory, and takes into account the waviness, orientations, and spatial distribution of the fibers, as well as the material nonlinearity at finite-strain deformation. In an illustrative simulation, the predictions of the macroscopic stress-strain relation, and the statistical deformation of the fibers are compared to the UF model, as well as finite-element (FE) simulation. Our predictions agree well with the FE results, while the UF predictions significantly overestimate. The effects of fiber distribution and waviness on the macroscopic stress-strain relation are also investigated. The present mathematical model may serves as a foundation for native as well as for engineered tissues and biomaterials.},

Biomech. Eng., 135(7), pp. 71010-71012). to develop a structural constitutive model for the PA wall tissue. Novel to the present approach was the treatment of the elastin network as a distributed fiber network rather than a continuum phase. We then utilized this model to delineate structure-function differences in the PA wall at the juvenile and adult stages. Overall, the predicted elastin moduli exhibited minor differences remained largely unchanged with age and region (in the range of 150 to 200 kPa). Similarly, the predicted collagen moduli ranged from ∼1,600 to 2700 kPa in the four regions studied in the juvenile state. Interestingly, we found for the medial region that the elastin and collagen fiber splay underwent opposite changes (collagen standard deviation juvenile = 17 deg to adult = 28 deg, elastin standard deviation juvenile = 35 deg to adult = 27 deg), along with a trend towards more rapid collagen fiber strain recruitment with age, along with a drop in collagen fiber moduli, which went from 2700 kPa for the juvenile stage to 746 kPa in the adult. These changes were likely due to the previously observed impingement of the relatively stiff ascending aorta on the growing PA medial region. Intuitively, the effects of the local impingement would be to lower the local wall stress, consistent with the observed parallel decrease in collagen modulus. These results suggest that during the postnatal somatic growth period local stresses can substantially modulate regional tissue microstructure and mechanical behaviors in the PA. We further underscore that our previous studies indicated an increase in effective PA wall stress with postnatal maturation. When taken together with the fact that the observed changes in mechanical behavior and structure in the growing PA wall were modest in the other three regions studied, our collective results suggest that the majority of the growing PA wall is subjected to increasing stress levels with age without undergoing major structural adaptations. This observation is contrary to the accepted theory of maintenance of homeostatic stress levels in the regulation of vascular function, and suggests alternative mechanisms might regulate postnatal somatic growth. Understanding the underlying mechanisms will help to improve our understanding of congenital defects of the PA and lay the basis for functional duplication in their repair and replacement.},

  abstract   = {Structural constitutive models integrate information on tissue composition and structure, avoiding ambiguities in material characterization. However, critical structural information (such as fiber orientation) must be modeled using assumed statistical distributions, with the distribution parameters estimated from fits to the mechanical test data. Thus, full realization of structural approaches continues to be limited without direct quantitative structural information for direct implementation or to validate model predictions. In the present study, fiber orientation information obtained using small angle light scattering (SALS) was directly incorporated into a structural constitutive model based on work by Lanir (J. Biomech., v. 16, pp. 1-12, 1983). Demonstration of the model was performed using existing biaxial mechanical and fiber orientation data for native bovine pericardium (Sacks and Chuong, ABME, v.26, pp. 892-902, 1998). The structural constitutive model accurately predicted the complete measured biaxial mechanical response. An important aspect of this approach is that only a single equibiaxial test to determine the effective fiber stress-strain response and the SALS-derived fiber orientation distribution were required to determine the complete planar biaxial mechanical response. Changes in collagen fiber crimp under equibiaxial strain suggest that, at the meso-scale, fiber deformations follow the global tissue strains. This result supports the assumption of affine strain to estimate the fiber strains. However, future evaluations will have to be performed for tissue subjected to a wider range of strain to more fully validate the current approach.},

  abstract   = {The tensile stress-strain behavior of ligaments and tendons begins with a toe region that is believed to result from the straightening of crimped collagen fibrils. The in situ mechanical function is mostly confined to this toe region and changes in crimp morphology are believed to be associated with pathological conditions. A relatively new imaging technique, optical coherence tomography (OCT), provides a comparatively inexpensive method for nondestructive investigation of tissue ultrastructure with resolution on the order of 15 microm and the potential for use in a clinical setting. The objectives of this work were to assess the utility of OCT for visualizing crimp period, and to use OCT to determine how crimp period changed as a function of applied tensile strain in rat tail tendon fascicles. Fascicles from rat tail tendons were subjected to 0.5 percent strain increments up to 5 percent and imaged at each increment using OCT. A comparison between OCT images and optical microscopy images taken between crossed polarizing lenses showed a visual correspondence between features indicative of crimp pattern. Crimp pattern always disappeared completely before 3 percent axial strain was reached. Average crimp period increased as strain increased, but both elongation and shortening occurred within single crimp periods during the application of increasing strain to the fascicle.},

The model considers the randomly crimped morphology of individual collagen fibers, a morphology typically seen in photomicrographs of tissue samples. It describes the relationship between the fiber endpoints and its arc-length in terms of a measurable quantity, which can be estimated from image data. The collective mechanical behavior of collagen fibers is presented in terms of an explicit expression for the strain-energy function, where a fiber-specific random variable is approximated by a Beta distribution. The model-related stress and elasticity tensors are provided. Two representative numerical examples are analyzed with the aim of demonstrating the peculiar mechanism of the constitutive model and quantifying the effect of parameter changes on the mechanical response. In particular, a fibrous tissue, assumed to be (nearly) incompressible, is subject to a uniaxial extension along the fiber direction, and, separately, to pure shear. It is shown that the fiber crimp model can reproduce several of the expected characteristics of fibrous tissues.},

  abstract   = {A microstructurally oriented constitutive formulation for the hyperelastic response of crimped collagen fibrils existing in soft connective tissues is proposed. The model is based on observations that collagen fibrils embedded in a soft matrix crimp into a smooth three-dimensional pattern when unloaded. Following ideas presented by Beskos and Jenkins [Beskos, D., Jenkins, J., 1975. A mechanical model for mammalian tendon. ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics 42, 755–758] and Freed and Doehring [Freed, A., Doehring, T., 2005. Elastic model for crimped collagen fibrils. Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 127, 587–593] the collagen fibril crimp is approximated by a cylindrical helix to represent the constitutive behavior of the hierarchical organized substructure of biological tissues at the fibrillar level. The model is derived from the nonlinear axial force–stretch relationship of an extensible helical spring, including the full extension of the spring as a limit case. The geometrically nonlinear solution of the extensible helical spring is carried out by an iterative procedure. The model only requires one material parameter and two geometrical parameters to be determined from experiments. The ability of the proposed model to reproduce the biomechanical response of fibrous tissues is demonstrated for fascicles from rat tail tendons, for porcine cornea strips, and for bovine Achilles tendons.},

Atomistic modeling predicts a persistence length of tropocollagen molecules ξ ≈ 23.4 nm, close to experimental measurements. Our studies suggest that to describe large-strain or hyperelastic properties, it is critical to include a correct description of the bond behavior and breaking processes at large bond stretch, information that stems from the quantum chemical details of bonding. We use full atomistic calculations to derive parameters for a mesoscopic bead-spring model of tropocollagen molecules. We demonstrate that the mesoscopic model enables one to study the finite temperature, long-time scale behavior of tropocollagen fibers, illustrating the dynamics of solvated tropocollagen molecules for different molecular lengths.},

  abstract   = {In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the constituent fibers follow an affine deformation kinematic model for planar collagenous tissues. Results from two experimental datasets were utilized, taken at two scales (nanometer and micrometer), using mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) tissues as the representative tissue. We simulated MVAL collagen fiber network as an ensemble of undulated fibers under a generalized two-dimensional deformation state, by representing the collagen fibrils based on a planar sinusoidally shaped geometric model. The proposed approach accounted for collagen fibril amplitude, crimp period, and rotation with applied macroscopic tissue-level deformation. When compared to the small angle x-ray scattering measurements, the model fit the data well, with an r(2) = 0.976. This important finding suggests that, at the homogenized tissue-level scale of approximately 1 mm, the collagen fiber network in the MVAL deforms according to an affine kinematics model. Moreover, with respect to understanding its function, affine kinematics suggests that the constituent fibers are largely noninteracting and deform in accordance with the bulk tissue. It also suggests that the collagen fibrils are tightly bounded and deform as a single fiber-level unit. This greatly simplifies the modeling efforts at the tissue and organ levels, because affine kinematics allows a straightforward connection between the macroscopic and local fiber strains. It also suggests that the collagen and elastin fiber networks act independently of each other, with the collagen and elastin forming long fiber networks that allow for free rotations. Such freedom of rotation can greatly facilitate the observed high degree of mechanical anisotropy in the MVAL and other heart valves, which is essential to heart valve function. These apparently novel findings support modeling efforts directed toward improving our fundamental understanding of tissue biomechanics in healthy and diseased conditions.},

  abstract   = {While the mechanical behaviors of the fibrosa and ventricularis layers of the aortic valve (AV) leaflet are understood, little information exists on their mechanical interactions mediated by the GAG-rich central spongiosa layer. Parametric simulations of the interlayer interactions of the AV leaflets in flexure utilized a tri-layered finite element (FE) model of circumferentially oriented tissue sections to investigate inter-layer sliding hypothesized to occur. Simulation results indicated that the leaflet tissue functions as a tightly bonded structure when the spongiosa effective modulus was at least 25 \% that of the fibrosa and ventricularis layers. Novel studies that directly measured transmural strain in flexure of AV leaflet tissue specimens validated these findings. Interestingly, a smooth transmural strain distribution indicated that the layers of the leaflet indeed act as a bonded unit, consistent with our previous observations (Stella and Sacks in J Biomech Eng 129:757-766, 2007) of a large number of transverse collagen fibers interconnecting the fibrosa and ventricularis layers. Additionally, when the tri-layered FE model was refined to match the transmural deformations, a layer-specific bimodular material model (resulting in four total moduli) accurately matched the transmural strain and moment-curvature relations simultaneously. Collectively, these results provide evidence, contrary to previous assumptions, that the valve layers function as a bonded structure in the low-strain flexure deformation mode. Most likely, this results directly from the transverse collagen fibers that bind the layers together to disable physical sliding and maintain layer residual stresses. Further, the spongiosa may function as a general dampening layer while the AV leaflets deforms as a homogenous structure despite its heterogeneous architecture.},

  abstract   = {Gradual collagen recruitment has been hypothesized as the underlying mechanism for the mechanical stiffening with increasing stress in arteries. In this work, we investigated this hypothesis in eight rabbit carotid arteries by directly measuring the distribution of collagen recruitment stretch under increasing circumferential loading using a custom uniaxial (UA) extension device combined with a multi-photon microscope (MPM). This approach allowed simultaneous mechanical testing and imaging of collagen fibers without traditional destructive fixation methods. Fiber recruitment was quantified from 3D rendered MPM images, and fiber orientation was measured in projected stacks of images. Collagen recruitment was observed to initiate at a finite strain, corresponding to a sharp increase in the measured mechanical stiffness, confirming the previous hypothesis and motivating the development of a new constitutive model to capture this response. Previous constitutive equations for the arterial wall have modeled the collagen contribution with either abrupt recruitment at zero strain, abrupt recruitment at finite strain or as gradual recruitment beginning at infinitesimal strain. Based on our experimental data, a new combined constitutive model was presented in which fiber recruitment begins at a finite strain with activation stretch represented by a probability distribution function. By directly including this recruitment data, the collagen contribution was modeled using a simple Neo-Hookean equation. As a result, only two phenomenological material constants were required from the fit to the stress stretch data. Three other models for the arterial wall were then compared with these results. The approach taken here was successful in combining stress-strain analysis with simultaneous microstructural imaging of collagen recruitment and orientation, providing a new approach by which underlying fiber architecture may be quantified and included in constitutive equations.},

ES-PEUU scaffolds can be fabricated to have a well-aligned fiber network, which is important for applications involving mechanically anisotropic soft tissues. We have developed ES-PEUU scaffolds under variable speed conditions and modeled the effects of fiber orientation on the macro-mechanical properties of the scaffold. To illustrate the ability to simulate native tissue mechanical behavior, we demonstrated that the high velocity spun scaffolds exhibited highly anisotropic mechanical properties closely resembling the native pulmonary heart valve leaflet. Moreover, use of the present fiber-level structural constitutive model allows for the determination of electrospinning conditions to tailor ES-PEUU scaffolds for specific soft tissue applications. The results of this study will help to provide the basis for rationally designed mechanically anisotropic soft tissue engineered implants.},

  abstract   = {Characterization of the mechanical properties of the native mitral valve leaflets at physiological strain rates is a critical step in improving our understanding of MV function and providing experimental data for dynamic constitutive models. We explored, for the first time, the effects of strain rate (from quasi-static to physiologic) on the biaxial mechanical properties of the native mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL). A novel high-speed biaxial testing device was developed, capable of achieving in vitro strain rates reported for the MVAL (Sacks et al., Ann. Biomed. Eng. 30(10):1280-1290, 2002). Porcine MVAL specimens were loaded to physiological load levels with cycle periods of 15, 1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 s. The resulting loading stress-strain responses were found to be remarkably independent of strain rate. The hysteresis, defined as the fraction of the membrane strain energy between the loading and unloading curves tension-areal stretch curves, was low (approximately 12\%) and did not vary with strain rate. The results of the present work indicated that MVAL tissues exhibit complete strain rate insensitivity at and below physiological strain rates under physiological loading conditions. These novel results suggest that experimental tests utilizing quasi-static strain rates are appropriate for constitutive model development for mitral valve tissues. The mechanisms underlying this quasi-elastic behavior are as yet unknown, but are likely an important functional aspect of native mitral valve tissues and clearly warrant further study.},

  abstract   = {A fundamental assumption in mitral valve (MV) therapies is that a repaired or replaced valve should mimic the functionality of the native valve as closely as possible. Thus, improvements in valvular treatments are dependent on the establishment of a complete understanding of the function and mechanical properties of the native normal MV. In a recent study [Grashow et al. ABME 34(2), 2006] we demonstrated that the planar biaxial stress-strain relationship of the MV anterior leaflet (MVAL) exhibited minimal hysteresis and a stress-strain response independent of strain rate, suggesting that MVAL could be modeled as a "quasi-elastic" material. The objective of our current study was to expand these results to provide a more complete picture of the time-dependent mechanical properties of the MVAL. To accomplish this, biaxial stress-relaxation and creep studies were performed on porcine MVAL specimens. Our primary finding was that while the MVAL leaflet exhibited significant stress relaxation, it exhibited negligible creep over the 3-h test. These results furthered our assertion that the MVAL functionally behaves not as a linear or non-linear viscoelastic material, but as an anisotropic quasi-elastic material. These results appear to be unique in the soft tissue literature; suggesting that valvular tissues are unequalled in their ability to withstand significant loading without time-dependent material effects. Moreover, insight into these specialized characteristics can help guide and inform efforts directed toward surgical repair and engineered valvular tissue replacements.},

Thus, the quantification of fiber architecture is an important step in developing an understanding of the mechanics of planar tissues in health and disease. We have used small angle light scattering (SALS) to map the gross fiber orientation of several soft membrane connective tissues. However, the device and analysis methods used in these studies required extensive manual intervention and were unsuitable for largescale fiber architectural mapping studies. We have developed an improved SALS device that allows for rapid data acquisition, automated high spatial resolution specimen positioning, and new analysis methods suitable for large-scale mapping studies. Extensive validation experiments revealed that the SALS device can accurately measure fiber orientation for up to a tissue thickness of at least 500 $\mu$m to an angular resolution of∼1o and a spatial resolution of{\textpm}254 $\mu$m. To demonstrate the new device's capabilities, structural measurements from porcine aortic valve leaflets are presented. Results indicate that the new SALS device provides an accurate method for rapid quantification of the gross fiber structure of planar connective tissues.},

Single collagen fibrils, the basic components of the collagen fiber, have a characteristic highly organized structure. Fibrils were isolated from collagenous materials and their mechanical properties were studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this study, we determined the Young's modulus of single collagen fibrils at ambient conditions from bending tests after depositing the fibrils on a poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) substrate containing micro-channels. Force-indentation relationships of freely suspended collagen fibrils were determined by loading them with a tip-less cantilever. From the deflection-piezo displacement curve, force-indentation curves could be deduced. With the assumption that the behavior of collagen fibrils can be described by the linear elastic theory of isotropic materials and that the fibrils are freely supported at the rims, a Young's modulus of 5.4 ± 1.2 GPa was determined. After cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, the Young's modulus of a single fibril increases to 14.7 ± 2.7 GPa. When it is assumed that the fibril would be fixed at the ends of the channel the Young's moduli of native and cross-linked collagen fibrils are calculated to be 1.4 ± 0.3 GPa and 3.8 ± 0.8 GPa, respectively. The minimum and maximum values determined for native and glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen fibrils represent the boundaries of the Young's modulus. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Determining the mechanical properties of single collagen fibrils (diameter 50–200 nm) provides new insights into collagen structure. In this work, the reduced modulus of collagen was measured by nanoindentation using atomic force microscopy. For individual type 1 collagen fibrils from rat tail, the modulus was found to be in the range from 5 GPa to 11.5 GPa (in air and at room temperature). The hypothesis that collagen anisotropy is due to the subfibrils being aligned along the fibril axis is supported by nonuniform surface imprints performed by high load nanoindentation.},

The characteristic properties of the glass transitions in amorphous gelatins and crystalline gelatins with different melting heats and different contents of the ordered phase were established. Special attention is paid to the structural properties of free and bound water. The dependence of the glass transition temperature T g on the bound water content was shown to be of general applicability for many denatured biopolymers. Free water in gelatins, in distinction to the bound water, does not act as a plasticizer, but forms a rigid matrix inhibiting the glass transition.},

Raman spectra, collected on the same collagen samples on which these forces were measured, reveal a continuous change in water hydrogen-bonding structure as a function of separation between collagen triple helices. The varying spectral parameters track the force-distance curve. The energetic cost of water “restructuring,” estimated from the spectra, is consistent with the measured energy of intermolecular interaction. These correlations support the idea that the change in water structure underlies the exponentially varying forces seen in this system at least over the 13–18-Å range of interaxial separations.},

  abstract   = {Estimation of regional tissue stresses in the functioning heart valve remains an important goal in our understanding of normal valve function and in developing novel engineered tissue strategies for valvular repair and replacement. Methods to accurately estimate regional tissue stresses are thus needed for this purpose, and in particular to develop accurate, statistically informed means to validate computational models of valve function. Moreover, there exists no currently accepted method to evaluate engineered heart valve tissues and replacement heart valve biomaterials undergoing valvular stresses in blood contact. While we have utilized mitral valve anterior leaflet valvuloplasty as an experimental approach to address this limitation, robust computational techniques to estimate implant stresses are required. In the present study, we developed a novel numerical analysis approach for estimation of the in-vivo stresses of the central region of the mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) delimited by a sonocrystal transducer array. The in-vivo material properties of the MVAL were simulated using an inverse FE modeling approach based on three pseudo-hyperelastic constitutive models: the neo-Hookean, exponential-type isotropic, and full collagen-fiber mapped transversely isotropic models. A series of numerical replications with varying structural configurations were developed by incorporating measured statistical variations in MVAL local preferred fiber directions and fiber splay. These model replications were then used to investigate how known variations in the valve tissue microstructure influence the estimated ROI stresses and its variation at each time point during a cardiac cycle. Simulations were also able to include estimates of the variation in tissue stresses for an individual specimen dataset over the cardiac cycle. Of the three material models, the transversely anisotropic model produced the most accurate results, with ROI averaged stresses at the fully-loaded state of 432.6+/-46.5 kPa and 241.4+/-40.5 kPa in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively. We conclude that the present approach can provide robust instantaneous mean and variation estimates of tissue stresses of the central regions of the MVAL.},

  abstract   = {We measured leaflet displacements and used inverse finite-element analysis to define, for the first time, the material properties of mitral valve (MV) leaflets in vivo. Sixteen miniature radiopaque markers were sewn to the MV annulus, 16 to the anterior MV leaflet, and 1 on each papillary muscle tip in 17 sheep. Four-dimensional coordinates were obtained from biplane videofluoroscopic marker images (60 frames/s) during three complete cardiac cycles. A finite-element model of the anterior MV leaflet was developed using marker coordinates at the end of isovolumic relaxation (IVR; when the pressure difference across the valve is approximately 0), as the minimum stress reference state. Leaflet displacements were simulated during IVR using measured left ventricular and atrial pressures. The leaflet shear modulus (G(circ-rad)) and elastic moduli in both the commisure-commisure (E(circ)) and radial (E(rad)) directions were obtained using the method of feasible directions to minimize the difference between simulated and measured displacements. Group mean (+/-SD) values (17 animals, 3 heartbeats each, i.e., 51 cardiac cycles) were as follows: G(circ-rad) = 121 +/- 22 N/mm2, E(circ) = 43 +/- 18 N/mm2, and E(rad) = 11 +/- 3 N/mm2 (E(circ) {\textgreater} E(rad), P {\textless} 0.01). These values, much greater than those previously reported from in vitro studies, may result from activated neurally controlled contractile tissue within the leaflet that is inactive in excised tissues. This could have important implications, not only to our understanding of mitral valve physiology in the beating heart but for providing additional information to aid the development of more durable tissue-engineered bioprosthetic valves.},

Both anterior and posterior leaflets were less extensible in the circumferential than in the radial direction under equibiaxial stretch, with stress ratios of 5.7 and 4.3, respectively. The posterior leaflets exhibited greater extensibility in both directions and lower circumferential posttransitional moduli (ranges 690-820 vs. 2,500-3,200 N/m for anterior). This larger posterior extensibility may be due to the greater number of chordal attachments, which provide additional mechanical stability to this structure. Coupling of radial and circumferential mechanical behavior was evidenced by the response to different stretch protocols, indicating a complex microstructural coupling between individual collagen fibers or bundles. These are the first biaxial data for mitral valves and are a foundation for the development of a more detailed quantitative material description.},

  abstract   = {Recent long-term studies showed an unsatisfactory recurrence rate of severe mitral regurgitation 3-5 years after surgical repair, suggesting that excessive tissue stresses and the resulting strain-induced tissue failure are potential etiological factors controlling the success of surgical repair for treating mitral valve (MV) diseases. We hypothesized that restoring normal MV tissue stresses in MV repair techniques would ultimately lead to improved repair durability through the restoration of MV normal homeostatic state. Therefore, we developed a micro- and macro- anatomically accurate MV finite element model by incorporating actual fiber microstructural architecture and a realistic structure-based constitutive model. We investigated MV closing behaviors, with extensive in vitro data used for validating the proposed model. Comparative and parametric studies were conducted to identify essential model fidelity and information for achieving desirable accuracy. More importantly, for the first time, the interrelationship between the local fiber ensemble behavior and the organ-level MV closing behavior was investigated using a computational simulation. These novel results indicated not only the appropriate parameter ranges, but also the importance of the microstructural tuning (i.e., straightening and re-orientation) of the collagen/elastin fiber networks at the macroscopic tissue level for facilitating the proper coaptation and natural functioning of the MV apparatus under physiological loading at the organ level. The proposed computational model would serve as a logical first step toward our long-term modeling goal-facilitating simulation-guided design of optimal surgical repair strategies for treating diseased MVs with significantly enhanced durability.},

  abstract   = {Fundamental to developing a deeper understanding of pathophysiological remodeling in mitral valve (MV) disease is the development of an accurate tissue-level constitutive model. In the present work, we developed a novel meso-scale (i.e. at the level of the fiber, 10-100mum in length scale) structural constitutive model (MSSCM) for MV leaflet tissues. Due to its four-layer structure, we focused on the contributions from the distinct collagen and elastin fiber networks within each tissue layer. Requisite collagen and elastin fibrous structural information for each layer were quantified using second harmonic generation microscopy and conventional histology. A comprehensive mechanical dataset was also used to guide model formulation and parameter estimation. Furthermore, novel to tissue-level structural constitutive modeling approaches, we allowed the collagen fiber recruitment function to vary with orientation. Results indicated that the MSSCM predicted a surprisingly consistent mean effective collagen fiber modulus of 162.72MPa, and demonstrated excellent predictive capability for extra-physiological loading regimes. There were also anterior-posterior leaflet-specific differences, such as tighter collagen and elastin fiber orientation distributions (ODF) in the anterior leaflet, and a thicker and stiffer atrialis in the posterior leaflet. While a degree of angular variance was observed, the tight valvular tissue ODF also left little room for any physically meaningful angular variance in fiber mechanical responses. Finally, a novel fibril-level (0.1-1mum) validation approach was used to compare the predicted collagen fiber/fibril mechanical behavior with extant MV small angle X-ray scattering data. Results demonstrated excellent agreement, indicating that the MSSCM fully captures the tissue-level function. Future utilization of the MSSCM in computational models of the MV will aid in producing highly accurate simulations in non-physiological loading states that can occur in repair situations, as well as guide the form of simplified models for real-time simulation tools.},

  abstract   = {Exogenous cross-linking of soft collagenous tissues is a common method for biomaterial development and medical therapies. To enable improved applications through computational methods, physically realistic constitutive models are required. Yet, despite decades of research, development and clinical use, no such model exists. In this study, we develop the first rigorous full structural model (i.e. explicitly incorporating various features of the collagen fibre architecture) for exogenously cross-linked soft tissues. This was made possible, in-part, with the use of native to cross-linked matched experimental datasets and an extension to the collagenous structural constitutive model so that the uncross-linked collagen fibre responses could be mapped to the cross-linked configuration. This allowed us to separate the effects of cross-linking from kinematic changes induced in the cross-linking process, which in turn allowed the non-fibrous tissue matrix component and the interaction effects to be identified. It was determined that the matrix could be modelled as an isotropic material using a modified Yeoh model. The most novel findings of this study were that: (i) the effective collagen fibre modulus was unaffected by cross-linking and (ii) fibre-ensemble interactions played a large role in stress development, often dominating the total tissue response (depending on the stress component and loading path considered). An important utility of the present model is its ability to separate the effects of exogenous cross-linking on the fibres from changes due to the matrix. Applications of this approach include the utilization in the design of novel chemical treatments to produce specific mechanical responses and the study of fatigue damage in bioprosthetic heart valve biomaterials.},

In this work, the localization and association of the noncollagenous bone matrix proteins osteonectin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin with calcification, lipoproteins, thrombus/hemorrhage (T/H), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human carotid arteries from endarterectomy samples have been determined. According to the recent American Heart Association classification, 6 of the advanced lesions studied were type V (fibroatheroma) and 16 type VI (complicated). Osteonectin, osteocalcin, and osteopontin were identified by monoclonal antibodies IIIA(3)A(8), G12, and MPIIIB10(1) and antiserum LF-123. Apolipoprotein (apo) AI, B, and E; lipoprotein(a); fibrinogen; fibrin; fragment D/D- dimer; MMP-2 (gelatinase A); and MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) were identified with previously characterized antibodies. Calcium phosphate deposits (von Kossa's stain) were present in 82\% of samples (3 type V and 15 type VI). Osteonectin was localized in endothelial cells, SMCs, and macrophages and was associated with calcium deposits in 33\% of type V and 88\% of type VI lesions. Osteopontin was distributed similarly to osteonectin and was associated with calcium deposits in 50\% of type V and 94\% of type VI lesions. Osteocalcin was localized in large calcified areas only (in 17\% of type V and 38\% of type VI lesions). ApoB colocalized with cholesterol crystals and calcium deposits. Lipoprotein(a) was localized in the intima, subintima, and plaque shoulder. Fibrin (T/H) colocalized with bone matrix proteins in 33\% of type V and 69\% of type VI lesions. MMP-3 was cytoplasmic in most cells and colocalized with calcium and fibrin deposits. MMP-2 was less often associated with calcification. The results of this study show that osteonectin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin colocalized with calcium deposits with apoB, fibrin, and MMP-3 in advanced, symptomatic carotid lesions. These data suggest that the occurrence of T/H might contribute to dystrophic arterial calcification in the progression and complications of atherosclerosis.},

  abstract   = {Substitute heart valves composed of human or animal tissues have been used since the early 1960s, when aortic valves obtained fresh from human cadavers were transplanted to other individuals as allografts. Today, tissue valves are used in 40\% or more of valve replacements worldwide, predominantly as stented porcine aortic valves (PAV) and bovine pericardial valves (BPV) preserved by glutaraldehyde (GLUT) (collectively termed bioprostheses). The principal disadvantage of tissue valves is progressive calcific and noncalcific deterioration, limiting durability. Native heart valves (typified by the aortic valve) are cellular and layered, with regional specializations of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These elements facilitate marked repetitive changes in shape and dimension throughout the cardiac cycle, effective stress transfer to the adjacent aortic wall, and ongoing repair of injury incurred during normal function. Although GLUT bioprostheses mimic natural aortic valve structure (a) their cells are nonviable and thereby incapable of normal turnover or remodeling ECM proteins; (b) their cuspal microstructure is locked into a configuration which is at best characteristic of one phase of the cardiac cycle (usually diastole); and (c) their mechanical properties are markedly different from those of natural aortic valve cusps. Consequently, tissue valves suffer a high rate of progressive and age-dependent structural valve deterioration resulting in stenosis or regurgitation ({\textgreater}50\% of PAV overall fail within 10-15 years; the failure rate is nearly 100\% in 5 years in those {\textless}35 years old but only 10\% in 10 years in those {\textgreater}65). Two distinct processes-intrinsic calcification and noncalcific degradation of the ECM-account for structural valve deterioration. Calcification is a direct consequence of the inability of the nonviable cells of the GLUT-preserved tissue to maintain normally low intracellular calcium. Consequently, nucleation of calcium-phosphate crystals occurs at the phospholipid-rich membranes and their remnants. Collagen and elastin also calcify. Tissue valve mineralization has complex host, implant, and mechanical determinants. Noncalcific degradation in the absence of physiological repair mechanisms of the valvular structural matrix is increasingly being appreciated as a critical yet independent mechanism of valve deterioration. These degradation mechanisms are largely rationalized on the basis of the changes to natural valves when they are fabricated into a tissue valve (mentioned above), and the subsequent interactions with the physiologic environment that are induced following implantation. The "Holy Grail" is a nonobstructive, nonthrombogenic tissue valve which will last the lifetime of the patient (and potentially grow in maturing recipients). There is considerable activity in basic research, industrial development, and clinical investigation to improve tissue valves. Particularly exciting in concept, yet early in practice is tissue engineering, a technique in which an anatomically appropriate construct containing cells seeded on a resorbable scaffold is fabricated in vitro, then implanted. Remodeling in vivo, stimulated and guided by appropriate biological signals incorporated into the construct, is intended to recapitulate normal functional architecture.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Porcine bioprosthetic valves have excellent hemodynamics and do not require anticoagulation, but have limited durability. Cusp tearing is a major cause of bioprosthetic valve failure. It has been suggested that the mechanism of bioprosthetic valve failure is stiffening by calcification, which leads to elevated stresses and secondary collagen fiber damage and leaflet tearing. This thesis was tested in explanted porcine bioprostheses. METHODS: A total of 60 explanted porcine bioprosthetic valves was tested mechanically, and 15 explanted valves were examined grossly and histologically. Circumferentially and radially oriented samples of cusp tissue were tested uniaxially in a materials testing machine and compared with five controls. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) duration of implantation was 10.9+/-5.6 years. Circumferential specimens from explants were less extensible than controls (11.0+/-5.5\% versus 24.5+/-2.8\% strain, p {\textless}0.001), and failed at lower tensions (973+/-733 versus 3075+/-911 N/m, p = 0.001) and at lower strains (21.2+/-8.1\% versus 47.3+/-7.1\% strain, p {\textless}0.001). Radial specimens from explants were less extensible (28.7+/-6.8\% versus 39.2+/-5.9\% strain, p = 0.002) and failed at lower strains (60.3+/-17.3\% versus 112.2+/-24.9\% strain, p {\textless}0.001) than the controls. The stiffness of the explants was unchanged from controls in both circumferential and radial samples. There were no differences between explants and controls in radial and circumferential stiffness, and in radial failure strength. Calcification was mild and diffuse in most of the tested samples. Tears were found in areas without calcific deposits, along with breaks in collagen fiber bundles. CONCLUSION: These results do not support the thesis that calcification stiffens glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine bioprostheses, except when the entire cusp is transformed into a solid mass of mineral. Rather, leaflet tears may develop as a result of accumulated mechanical damage that is independent of calcification.},

  abstract   = {Calcification plays a major role in the failure of bioprosthetic and other tissue heart valve substitutes. Tissue valve calcification is initiated primarily within residual cells that have been devitalized, usually by glutaraldehyde pretreatment. The mechanism involves reaction of calcium-containing extracellular fluid with membrane-associated phosphorus to yield calcium phosphate mineral deposits. Calcification is accelerated by young recipient age, valve factors such as glutaraldehyde fixation, and increased mechanical stress. Recent studies have suggested that pathologic calcification is regulated by inductive and inhibitory factors, similar to the physiologic mineralization of bone. The most promising preventive strategies have included binding of calcification inhibitors to glutaraldehyde fixed tissue, removal or modification of calcifiable components, modification of glutaraldehyde fixation, and use of tissue cross linking agents other than glutaraldehyde. This review summarizes current concepts in the pathophysiology of tissue valve calcification, including emerging concepts of endogenous regulation, progress toward prevention of calcification, and issues related to calcification of the aortic wall of stentless bioprosthetic valves.},

  abstract   = {Numerical simulations of the anisotropic mechanical properties of soft tissues and tissue-derived biomaterials using accurate constitutive models remain an important and challenging research area in biomechanics. While most constitutive modeling efforts have focused on the characterization of experimental data, only limited studies are available on the feasibility of utilizing those models in complex computational applications. An example is the widely utilized exponential constitutive model proposed by Fung. Although present in the biomechanics literature for several decades, implementation of this model into finite element (FE) simulations has been limited. A major reason for limited numerical implementations are problems associated with inherent numerical instability and convergence. To address this issue, we developed and applied two restrictions for a generalized Fung-elastic constitutive model necessary to achieve numerical stability. These are (1) convexity of the strain energy function, and (2) the condition number of material stiffness matrix set lower than a prescribed value. These constraints were implemented in the nonlinear regression used for constitutive model parameter estimation to the experimental biaxial mechanical data. We then implemented the generalized Fung-elastic model into a commercial FE code (ABAQUS, Pawtucket, RI, USA). Single element and multi-element planar biaxial test simulations were conducted to verify the accuracy and robustness of the implementation. Results indicated that numerical convergence and accurate FE implementation were consistently obtained. The present study thus presents an integrated framework for accurate and robust implementation of pseudo-elastic constitutive models for planar soft tissues. Moreover, since our approach is formulated within a general FE code, it can be straightforwardly adopted across multiple software platforms.},

The degree of crosslinking determines the rate of resorption or replacement of the implanted materials by the host. Since biophysical and chemical methods to quantify these crosslinks have in general been difficult to evaluate, we have developed in vitro enzymatic approaches which enable us to correlate the degree of crosslinking with the rates of enzymatic degradation. When the number of stable crosslinks formed is large it is essential to partially unfold the collagen fibrils by heating or by exposure to denaturing agents to enhance their susceptibility to hydrolysis. In the present study we demonstrate that increasing the number of reactive amino groups on collagen by coupling 1,6-diaminohexane to carboxyl groups using a water soluble carbodiimide can significantly enhance the number of crosslinks introduced by glutaraldehyde. We also show that the enzymatic method developed correlates well with the biodegradation of radiolabeled crosslinked collagenous tissues implanted subcutaneously in rats.},

  abstract   = {Gluteraldehyde crosslinking of native or reconstituted collagen fibrils and tissues rich in collagen significantly reduces biodegradation. Other aldehydes are less efficient that glutaraldehyde in generating chemically, biologically, and thermally stable crosslinks. Tissues crosslinked with glutaraldehyde retain many of the viscolelastic properties of the native collagen fibrillar network which render them suitable for bioprostheses. Implants of collagenous materials crosslinked with glutaraldehyde are subject to long-term calcification, biodegradation, and low-grade immune reactions. We have attempted to overcome these problems by enhancing crosslinking through (a)bridging of activated carboxyl groups with diamines and (b)using glutaraldehyde to crosslink the e-NH2 groups in collagen and the unreacted amines introduced by aliphatic diamines. This crosslinking reduces tissue degradation and nearly eliminates humoral antibody induction. Covalent binding of diphosphonates, specifically 3-amino-1-hydroxypropane-1,1-diphosphoric acid (3-APD), and the chondroitin sulfate to collagen or to the crosslink enhanced collagen network reduces its potential for calcification. Platelet aggregation is also reduced by glutaraldehyde crosslinking and nearly eliminated by the covalent binding of chondroitin sulfate to collagen. The cytotoxicity of residual glutaraldehyde-leching through the interstices of the collagen fibrils or the tissue matrix-and of the reactive aldehydes associated with the bound polymeric glutaraldehyde can be minimized by neutralizationand thorough rinsing after crosslinking and storage in a nontoxic bacteriostatic solution.},

On the other hand, satisfactory results were obtained when cardiac valves made from glutaraldehyde fixed pericardium were stored in a solution containing 0.02% of propyl-hydroxy-benzoate and 0.18% methyl-hydroxy-benzoate. The valves stored in this solution and rinsed three times for 1 min in normal saline showed few signs of residual cytotoxicity.

In the presence of excess glutaraldehyde, this intermediate is quickly converted to a much larger intermediate which absorb strongly at 265 nm. The larger intermediates are finally altered to yield a strong absorption peak at 325 nm with no apparent change in the molecular weight.

Modification of lysyl residues was measured by amino acid analysis.

When the glutaraldehyde concentration was increased, the collagen became more insoluble, indicating the formation of intermolecular crosslinks. When reconstituted collagen fibers were reacted with low concentrations of glutaraldehyde, intermolecular crosslinks were formed, which prevented the material from being solubilized by CNBr. However, these materials could still be solubilized by collagenase. When the glutaraldehyde concentration was increased, the materials became resistant to collagenase, while there was only a small increase in the number of lysyl residues modified.

In this study, we utilized a small angle light scattering based tissue pre-sorting procedure to select BP specimens with a high degree of structural uniformity. Both conventional glutaraldehyde (GL) and photo-oxidation (PO) chemical treatment groups were studied, with untreated tissue used as the control group. A second set of GL and PO groups was prepared by prestretching them along the preferred fiber direction during the chemical treatment. An extensive biaxial test protocol was used and the resulting stress-strain data fitted to an exponential strain energy function. The high structural uniformity resulted in both a consistent mechanical response and low variability in the material constants. For free fixed tissues, the strain energy per unit volume for GL treated BP was approximately 2.8 times that of PO treated BP at an equibiaxial Green's strain level of 0.16. Pre-stretched tissues exhibited a profound increase in both stiffness and the degree of anisotropy, with the GL treatment demonstrating a greater effect. Thus, structural control leads to an improved understanding of chemically treated BP mechanical properties. Judicious use of this knowledge can facilitate the design and enhanced long-term performance of bioprosthetic heart valves.},

This is due to the inability of current mechanical testing devices to induce a state of in-plane shear, due to the added cost and complexity. In the current study, a straightforward method is presented for planar biaxial testing that induces a combined state of in-plane shear and normal strains. The method relies on rotation of the test specimen's material axes with respect to the device axes and on rotating carriages to allow the specimen to undergo in-plane shear freely. To demonstrate the method, five glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium specimens were prepared with their preferred fiber directions (defining the material axes) oriented at 45 deg to the device axes to induce a maximum shear state. The test protocol included a wide range of biaxial strain states, and the resulting biaxial data re-expressed in material axes coordinate system. The resulting biaxial data was then fit to the following strain energy function W: [equation: see text] where E'ij is the Green's strain tensor in the material axes coordinate system and c and Ai are constants. While W was able to fit the data very well, the constants A5 and A6 were found not to contribute significantly to the fit and were considered unnecessary to model the shear strain response. In conclusion, while not able to control the amount of shear strain independently or induce a state of pure shear, the method presented readily produces a state of simultaneous in-plane shear and normal strains. Further, the method is very general and can be applied to any anisotropic planar tissue that has identifiable material axes.},

  abstract   = {Simulation of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues is critical for many physiological and medical device applications. Accurate mechanical test data is crucial for both obtaining the form and robust parameter determination of the constitutive model. For incompressible soft tissues that are either membranes or thin sections, planar biaxial mechanical testing configurations can provide much information about the anisotropic stress-strain behavior. However, the analysis of soft biological tissue planar biaxial mechanical test data can be complicated by in-plane shear, tissue heterogeneities, and inelastic changes in specimen geometry that commonly occur during testing. These inelastic effects, without appropriate corrections, alter the stress-traction mapping and violates equilibrium so that the stress tensor is incorrectly determined. To overcome these problems, we presented an analytical method to determine the Cauchy stress tensor from the experimentally derived tractions for tethered testing configurations. We accounted for the measured testing geometry and compensate for run-time inelastic effects by enforcing equilibrium using small rigid body rotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we simulated complete planar biaxial test configurations that incorporated actual device mechanisms, specimen geometry, and heterogeneous tissue fibrous structure using a finite element (FE) model. We determined that our method corrected the errors in the equilibrium of momentum and correctly estimated the Cauchy stress tensor. We also noted that since stress is applied primarily over a subregion bounded by the tethers, an adjustment to the effective specimen dimensions is required to correct the magnitude of the stresses. Simulations of various tether placements demonstrated that typical tether placements used in the current experimental setups will produce accurate stress tensor estimates. Overall, our method provides an improved and relatively straightforward method of calculating the resulting stresses for planar biaxial experiments for tethered configurations, which is especially useful for specimens that undergo large shear and exhibit substantial inelastic effects.},

  abstract   = {The present review surveys significant developments in the biomechanical characterization and computational simulation of biologically derived chemically cross-linked soft tissues, or 'heterograft' biomaterials, used in replacement bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV). A survey of mechanical characterization techniques, relevant mechanical properties and computational simulation approaches is presented for both the source tissues and cross-linked biomaterials. Since durability remains the critical problem with current bioprostheses, changes with the mechanical behavior with fatigue are also presented. Moreover, given the complex nature of the mechanical properties of heterograft biomaterials it is not surprising that most constitutive (stress-strain) models, historically used to characterize their behavior, were oversimplified. Simulations of BHV function utilizing these models have inevitably been inaccurate. Thus, more recent finite element simulations utilizing nonlinear constitutive models, which achieve greater model fidelity, are reviewed. An important conclusion of this review is the need for accurate constitutive models, rigorously validated with appropriate experimental data, in order that the design benefits of computational models can be realized. Finally, for at least the coming 20 years, BHVs fabricated from heterograft biomaterials will continue to be extensively used, and will probably remain as the dominant valve design. We should thus recognize that rational, scientifically based approaches to BHV biomaterial development and design can lead to significantly improved BHV, over the coming decades, which can potentially impact millions of patients worldwide with heart valve disease.},

  abstract   = {In the present study, the effects of initial collagen fiber orientation on the medium-term (up to 50 x 10(6) cycles) fatigue response of heart valve soft tissue biomaterials was investigated. Glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium (GLBP), preselected for uniform structure and collagen fiber orientation, was used as the representative heart valve biomaterial. Using specialized instrumentation, GLBP specimens were subjected to cyclic tensile loading to maximum stress levels of 500 +/- 50 kPa at a frequency of 22 Hz. Two sample groups were examined, one with the preferred collagen fiber direction parallel (PD) and perpendicular (XD) to the direction of applied strain. The primary findings indicated that GLBP fatigue response was highly sensitive to the direction of loading with respect to fiber orientation. Specifically, when loading perpendicular to the preferred collagen fiber orientation, fiber reorientation is the dominant mechanism. In contrast, when loaded parallel to the preferred fiber direction a reduction in both collagen fiber crimp and fiber reorientation occurred. Moreover, alterations in the degree and direction of mechanical anisotropy can be inducted by cyclic loading when specimens are loaded perpendicular to the preferred fiber direction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) results indicate that molecular-level damage to collagen occurs in both groups after only 20 x 10(6) cycles. Taken as a whole, the results of this study suggest that initial collagen orientation plays a critical role in bioprosthetic heart valve biomaterial fatigue response.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: Calcification of polyurethane prosthetic valve leaflets causes a major functional impairment. Previously we showed that polyurethane heart valves modified with covalently linked bisphosphonate groups were resistant to calcification in vivo. However, we also found that the highly polar anionic bisphosphonate groups on the polyurethane surface attracted sodium counter ion adsorption, and thereby increased the elastomer's water absorption to 20\% of total weight. In this study we address the increased water absorption by investigating the hypothesis that covalently attaching cationic diethylamino groups to the bisphosphonate-modified polyurethane will reduce water absorption. Thus we evaluated the mechanical and in vivo anticalcification properties of heart-valve leaflets composed of this modified polymer. METHODS: Diethylamino and bisphosphonate groups (DBP) were appended to the polyurethane Biospan's hard segment using previously published bromoalkylation methodology. Water absorption and biaxial mechanical and uniaxial failure testing were used to determine the mechanical properties of the DBP-modified polymer. Rat subdermal implants (60 days) and extended (150 days) single pulmonary leaflet replacements in juvenile sheep provided in vivo assessments of the bisphosphonate-modified polyurethane. RESULTS: The water absorption properties of the DBP-modified polymers and unmodified polyurethanes were 1.86 and 2.3 \%, respectively. Biaxial mechanical tests showed the DBP-modified polymer was more compliant than the unmodified control material, but all polymeric material had similar uniaxial failure properties. In both rat subdermal and sheep circulatory implants, the DBP-modified polyurethane resisted calcification, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy, with complete calcification inhibition in prosthetic sheep valve leaflet replacements. CONCLUSION: DBP polyurethane possesses physical (water absorption) and biomechanical properties comparable to unmodified polyurethane and can resist intrinsic heart-valve leaflet calcification in blood-stream implants.},

  abstract   = {Zero transvalvular pressure fixation is thought to improve porcine bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) durability by preserving the collagen fiber architecture of the native tissue, and thereby native mechanical properties. However, it is not known if the native mechanical properties are stable during long-term valve operation and thus provide additional durability. To address this question, we examined the biaxial mechanical properties of porcine BHV fixed at 0 and 4mmHg transvalvular pressure following 0, 1 x 10(6), 50 x 10(6), and 200 x 10(6) in vitro accelerated test cycles. At 0 cycles, the extensibility and degree of axial cross-coupling of the zero-pressure-fixed cusps were higher than those of the low-pressure-fixed cusps. Furthermore, extensibility of the zero-pressure-fixed tissue decreased between 1 x 10(6) and 50 x 10(6) cycles, approaching that of the low-pressure-fixed tissue, whose extensibility was unchanged over 0-200 x 10(6) cycles. The decrease in extensibility of the zero-pressure-fixed tissue between 1 x 10(6) and 50 x 10(6) cycles may be attributable to the ability of its collagen fibers to undergo larger changes in orientation and crimp with cyclic loading. These observations suggest that the collagen fiber architecture of the 0-mmHg-fixed porcine BHV, although locked in place by chemical fixation, may not be maintained over a sufficient number of cycles to be clinically beneficial. This study further underscores that chemically treated collagen fibers can undergo conformational changes under long-term cyclic loading not associated with damage.},

  abstract   = {Biologically derived, chemically modified collagenous tissues are being increasingly used to fabricate cardiac valve prostheses and as biomaterials in cardiovascular repair. A stress-free state during chemical modification has been shown to preserve the collagen fiber architecture of the native tissue, potentially preserving native mechanical properties and improving prostheses durability. However, it is not known if the native collagen fiber architecture is stable during long-term in vivo operation. To address this question, we obtained porcine aortic valves chemically treated at (i) 0mmHg transvalvular pressure (with 40mmHg aortic pressure) and (ii) 4mmHg transvalvular pressure, then subjected the valves to 0,1x10(6), 50x10(6), and 200x10(6) in vitro accelerated wear testing (AWT) cycles. The resulting changes in collagen fiber architecture were quantified using small angle light scattering analysis (SALS). SALS measurements indicated that collagen fibers in the 0mmHg pressure-fixed leaflets became more aligned between 1x10(6) and 50x10(6) AWT cycles. In contrast, only minor changes (not statistically significant) in collagen fiber orientation occurred in the 4mmHg pressure-fixed valvular tissue with cycling. It was also noted that although the 0mmHg group was fixed without transvalvular pressure, distention of the root induced significant changes in collagen structure of the leaflets. Overall, our observations suggest that the native collagen fiber crimp of the 0mmHg pressure-fixed leaflets were rapidly lost after only 50x10(6) AWT cycles (equivalent to approximately 1.6 patient years) and thus may not be maintained over a sufficient period of time to be clinically beneficial. Further, the collagen structure of the native aortic valve is exquisitely sensitive to dimensional change in the aortic root-independent of the presence of transvalvular pressure. Our findings also suggest that without in vivo remodeling, any collagenous tissue used to fabricate BHV may undergo similar degenerative, irreversible changes in vivo.},

  abstract   = {We have used hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) techniques in a sheep model to assess collagen crosslink stability and its contribution to the mechanical properties of the ovine thoracic aorta during perinatal and postnatal development. Aortic tissue was studied from fetal sheep, lambs, and adult sheep. Strips of tissue were loaded under isometric tension and heated to a 90 degrees C isotherm which was sustained for 3 hours. The decrease in load at this temperature is associated with collagen peptide bond hydrolysis and chain slippage, and the rate of this decrease is an inverse indicator of collagen crosslinking. The half-time of load decay (t1/2) was computed before and after tissue was treated with NaBH4 which stabilizes immature, reducible crosslinks. We observed a two-fold increase in t1/2 of untreated tissue from the lamb to the adult, indicating that aortic collagen crosslinking increased during postnatal development. Furthermore, the t1/2 of NaBH4-stabilized lamb tissue was similar to that of the untreated adult tissue, suggesting that much of the immature crosslinking in the lamb is stabilized during postnatal development. These observations suggest (a) increased crosslinking occurs during postnatal development and (b) that this increase is largely due to a conversion of immature crosslinks into their mature heat stable form.},

  abstract   = {Porcine bioprosthetic heart valves degenerate and fail mechanically through a mechanism that is currently not well understood. It has been suggested that damage to the elastin component of prosthetic valve cusps could be responsible for changes in the mechanical function of the valve that would predispose it to increased damage and ultimate failure. To determine whether damage to elastin can produce the structural and mechanical changes that could initiate the process of bioprosthetic valve degeneration, we developed an elastase treatment protocol that fragments elastin and negates its mechanical contribution to the valve tissue. Valve cusps were mechanically tested before and after digestion to measure the mechanical changes resulting from elastin damage. Elastin damage produced a decrease in radial and circumferential extensibility (from 43 to 18\% strain radially and 12 to 7\% strain circumferentially), with a slight increase in stiffness (1.3- 2.6kN/m for radial and 10.6-11.9kN/m for circumferential directions). Digestions with trypsin, which does not cleave elastin, confirmed that the changes in mechanics of the circumferential samples were likely due to the nonspecific removal of proteoglycans by elastase, while the changes in the radial samples were indeed due to elastin damage. Removing the mechanical contribution of elastin alters the mechanical behavior of the aortic valve cusp, primarily in the radial direction. This finding implies that damage to elastin will distend the cusps, reduce their extensibility, and increase their stiffness. Damage to elastin may therefore contribute to the degeneration and failure of prosthetic valves.},

  abstract   = {Improving cardiac valve bioprostheses (BHV) utilizing heterograft biomaterials requires a better understanding of their mechanical behavior. Flexure is a major mode of deformation for BHV leaflets during valve operation, inducing more complex deformation patterns within the tissue compared to tensile loads. In this study, we investigated the relation between collagen fiber preferred direction and the resulting flexural properties of native and glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium. 20mmx4mm strips were cut from the presorted sheets of bovine pericardium and divided into four groups: two directions of collagen fiber orientation in two groups of native and chemically treated specimens. Specimens were flexed in two different directions using a three-point bending technique (ASAIO J. 45(1999)59) and their flexural mechanical response compared. Results indicated that: (1) the relationship between the applied flexing moment and change of curvature of specimens was non-linear in both native and chemically fixed groups, (2) there were no directional differences in flexural properties when the bovine pericardium is flexed towards either the epi-pericardial or visceral surfaces in both native and chemically fixed specimens, (3) native and chemically fixed bovine pericardium were stiffer when flexed perpendicular to local preferred collagen fiber direction, and (4) chemical fixation increased the flexural rigidity of bovine pericardium. Results of this study indicate that the flexural properties of bovine pericardium are dominated by inter-fiber cross-links as opposed to the stiffness of the collagen fibers themselves. These findings can be used to guide the development of novel chemical treatment methods that seek to optimize biomechanical properties of heterograft biomaterials.},

  abstract   = {Collagen and elastin are thought to dominate the elasticity of the connective tissue including lung parenchyma. The glycosaminoglycans on the proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can affect the stretching and folding pattern of the fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal, and hypertonic solutions. We found that the stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure. Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of the hexagons at 30\% uniaxial strain increased linearly with osmolarity. We developed a two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted for the stress-strain curves observed under all experimental conditions. The model also predicted how aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain, which allowed us to estimate the Young's modulus of a single alveolar wall and a collagen fiber. We therefore identify a novel and important role for the proteoglycans: they stabilize the collagen-elastin network of connective tissues and contribute to lung elasticity and alveolar stability at low to medium lung volumes.},

  abstract   = {Dynamic shear properties of excised rabbit lungs were studied by measuring creep deformation after application of a step indentation force to the pleural surfaces by a rigid cylindrical punch. The punch diameter was 9.5 mm, and punch forces were 2,4, and 6 g. Measurements were made at lung volumes of 40, 60, and 90\% of the total lung capacity before and after lavage with 3-dimethyl siloxane, which provided a constant surface tension of 16 dyn/cm at the alveolar surfaces. A power-law model was fitted to creep data and then transformed into the frequency (f) domain by using Laplace transforms. The optimum model parameters were used to calculate shear elastance (E mu), shear resistance (R mu), and shear hysteresivity (2 pi fR mu/E mu) between 0.01 and 2.0 Hz. It was found that E mu slightly increased and R mu decreased nearly hyperbolically with increasing f, both decreased with increasing indentation force, and both increased with increasing mean lung volume. Shear hysteresivity decreased sharply from 0.01 to 0.25 Hz and then assumed a nearly steady value that was an order of magnitude lower than the value reported previously for uniformly oscillated lungs. Changes in E mu and R mu after lavage were correlated with changes in transpulmonary pressure and not with changes in surface film properties. These results suggest that in the breathing range of frequencies 1) the energy loss of lung parenchyma is a much smaller fraction of the stored elastic energy in shear than in uniformly oscillated lungs and 2) transpulmonary pressure, not dynamic properties of surface film, is the primary determinant of lung dynamic properties in shear.},

  abstract   = {In this paper we analyze some aspects of the mechanics of anisotropic non-linearly elastic solids for which the anisotropy is associated with two preferred directions, thereby modelling the effect of two families of fiber reinforcement. Particular attention is focused on the role of the invariant I-8, which couples the fiber kinematics in the constitutive law, and results are illustrated for a model strain-energy function that includes this invariant. The distinctive effects of this invariant on the stress-strain behaviour of the material and on the failure of ellipticity are discussed separately for pure homogeneous deformation and for a simple shear deformation. For pure homogeneous deformation it is shown that ellipticity fails with an associated weak surface of discontinuity that bisects the fiber directions. Moreover, ellipticity fails close to the reference configuration in either tension or compression. For simple shear it is found that loss of ellipticity occurs both for positive and negative shearing, and the orientation of the weak surface relative to the fiber directions is characterized in each case. Again ellipticity fails close to the reference configuration, and inclusion of the invariant I-8 in the constitutive law therefore has a pronounced destabilizing influence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess tissue anisotropy, tissue strips were cut at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees relative to the base-to-apex direction. Fresh anterior pericardium was modestly anisotropic, being least extensible in the base-to-apex direction; however, fixation removed this anisotropy. Fixation also produced a marked change in the response of the material to initial cyclic loading during preconditioning. Overall extensibility of the fixed material was significantly greater than that for the fresh tissue, consistent with a 10.7\% shrinkage in aldehydes calculated from strain at fracture data. Reductions in stress relaxation and creep after fixation were noted as well, consistent with intrafibrillar crosslinking. Cyclic hysteresis and ultimate tensile strength were unaffected. Since the observed changes in the stress-strain response were largely attributable to shrinkage, control of shrinkage by physical means would allow for engineering modification of bovine pericardial mechanics for controlled anisotropy.},

  abstract   = {Our previous two articles have shown that glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium is nearly isotropic, whether fixed without constraints, with tethering, or with pressure. In this study, we have used uniaxial stress during fixation to produce bovine pericardial material with marked tensile anisotropy. Rectangular and cruciate pericardial samples have been mechanically examined after one of four treatments: (i) fixation under 88-kPa uniaxial stress, (ii) fixation under 176-kPa uniaxial stress, (iii) 3 h of 176-kPa uniaxial stress in saline followed by 24-h fixation under the same stress, (iv) fixation under 176-kPa uniaxial stress followed by a second fixation under 176-kPa stress in a direction normal to the first. Strips of material were cut at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees to direction of the initial stress, and tested for response to cyclic loading, stress relaxation, plastic deformation, and fracture properties. Fixation under uniaxial stress produced anistropy similar to that seen in porcine aortic valve leaflets; however, the overall extensibility of the material depended on the applied stress and the aspect ratio of the stressed sample. While loading in saline produced no change, the sequential biaxial stressing produced a reduction in anisotropy, suggesting exposure of additional crosslinking sites. Uniaxial stress during fixation may be a useful method for construction of anisotropic heart valve leaflets.},

  abstract   = {The tensile properties of mitral valve chordae tendineae derive from their structural make-up. The objectives of this study were to compare the stress relaxation properties of different types of chordae and relate their variation to structural features. Fifty chordae from eight hearts were subjected to stress relaxation tests. The percent stress relaxation and the relaxation rates were found to increase in the order of marginal. basal, and strut chordae. The water content of the three types of chordae was the same (marginal 77.1+/-5.9\%, basal 77.0+/-3.4\%, strut 78.0+/-2.3\% wet weight). The collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in chordae were quantified using hydroxyproline assay, fastin elastin assay, and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, respectively. Collagen content of marginal chordae was only slightly less than that of basal and strut chordae (marginal 56.6+/-8.2\%, basal 61.4+/-5.6\%, strut 63.8+/-3.9\% dry weight). There was also no significant difference in elastin content between the chordae (marginal 5.3+/-3.2\%, basal 5.4+/-2.7\%, strut 4.6+/-1.7\% dry weight). However, the concentrations of unsulfated chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, and 4-sulfate chondroitin sulfate significantly decreased in the order of marginal, basal, and strut. The total GAG-content also decreased in the order of marginal, basal, and strut (p = 0.06). The greater amount of GAGs in marginal versus strut chordae is consistent with our previous observations that marginal chordae have a greater collagen fibril density and thus more GAG-mediated, fibril-to-fibril linkages. The greater number of proteoglycan linkages may prevent the slippage of fibrils with respect to each other, and thus reduce stress relaxation. The different viscoelastic properties of mitral valve chordae can thus be explained morphologically.},

The present study examines the conditions under which the elastic response of isotropic tissues, as modeled by structural constitutive equations, is physically plausible. The analysis skews that plausibility is ensured if the fibers' stretch force increases monotonically with the stretch and if the matrix osmotic pressure increases convexly with the concentration. Published data shows that both conditions prevail in soft tissues. If is thus concluded that structural modeling is compatible with physically plausible response.},

  abstract   = {We have recently demonstrated that noncalcific tissue damage can lead to significant collagen degradation in clinically explanted bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs). In the present study we quantified the early response of glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium (GLBP) to cyclic tensile loading to begin to elucidate the mechanisms of noncalcific tissue degeneration in BHV biomaterials. GLBP specimens were cycled at 30 Hz to a maximum uniaxial strain of 16\% (corresponding to approximately 1-MPa peak stress), with the loading direction parallel to the preferred collagen fiber (PD) direction. After 30 x 10(6) cycles, specimens were subjected to biaxial mechanical testing, then cycled until 65 x 10(6) cycles. The results indicated a permanent change in the unloaded tissue dimensions of +7.1\% strain in the PD direction and -7.7\% strain in the cross fiber direction (XD) after 65 x 10(6) cycles and an increase of the collagen crimp period from 40.6 to 45.2 microm by 65 x 10(6) cycles (p = 0.05). Fourier transform IR spectroscopy analysis indicated that cyclic fatigue of GLBP leads to both collagen conformational changes and early denaturation. Furthermore, no significant changes in areal strain were found under 1-MPa equibiaxial stress, indicating that cyclic loading changed the collagen fiber orientation but not the overall tissue compliance. These observations suggest that while deterioration of collagen begins immediately, fiber straightening and reorientation dominates the changes in the mechanical behavior up to 65 x 10(6) cycles. The present study underscores the complexity of the response of biologically derived biomaterials to cyclic mechanical loading. Improved understanding of these phenomena can potentially guide the development of novel chemical treatment methods that seek to improve BHV durability by minimizing these degenerative processes.},

  abstract   = {Despite continued progress in the treatment of aortic valve (AV) disease, current treatments continue to be challenged to consistently restore AV function for extended durations. Improved approaches for AV repair and replacement rests upon our ability to more fully comprehend and simulate AV function. While the elastic behavior the AV leaflet (AVL) has been previously investigated, time-dependent behaviors under physiological biaxial loading states have yet to be quantified. In the current study, we performed strain rate, creep, and stress-relaxation experiments using porcine AVL under planar biaxial stretch and loaded to physiological levels (60 N/m equi-biaxial tension), with strain rates ranging from quasi-static to physiologic. The resulting stress-strain responses were found to be independent of strain rate, as was the observed low level of hysteresis ( approximately 17\%). Stress relaxation and creep results indicated that while the AVL exhibited significant stress relaxation, it exhibited negligible creep over the 3h test duration. These results are all in accordance with our previous findings for the mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) [Grashow, J.S., Sacks, M.S., Liao, J., Yoganathan, A.P., 2006a. Planar biaxial creep and stress relaxatin of the mitral valve anterior leaflet. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 34 (10), 1509-1518; Grashow, J.S., Yoganathan, A.P., Sacks, M.S., 2006b. Biaxial stress-stretch behavior of the mitral valve anterior leaflet at physiologic strain rates. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 34 (2), 315-325], and support our observations that valvular tissues are functionally anisotropic, quasi-elastic biological materials. These results appear to be unique to valvular tissues, and indicate an ability to withstand loading without time-dependent effects under physiologic loading conditions. Based on a recent study that suggested valvular collagen fibrils are not intrinsically viscoelastic [Liao, J., Yang, L., Grashow, J., Sacks, M.S., 2007. The relation between collagen fibril kinematics and mechanical properties in the mitral valve anterior leaflet. Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 129 (1), 78-87], we speculate that the mechanisms underlying this quasi-elastic behavior may be attributed to inter-fibrillar structures unique to valvular tissues. These mechanisms are an important functional aspect of native valvular tissues, and are likely critical to improve our understanding of valvular disease and help guide the development of valvular tissue engineering and surgical repair.},

Since bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) continue to be the preferred replacement valve, there continues to be a strong need to develop better and more reliable BHVs through and improved the general understanding of BHV failure mechanisms. The major technological hurdle for the lifespan of the BHV implant continues to be the durability of the constituent leaflet biomaterials, which if improved can lead to substantial clinical impact. In order to develop improved solutions for BHV biomaterials, it is critical to have a better understanding of the inherent biomechanical behaviors of the leaflet biomaterials, including chemical treatment technologies, the impact of repetitive mechanical loading, and the inherent failure modes. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of these issues, with a focus on developing insight on the mechanisms of BHV function and failure. Additionally, this review provides a detailed summary of the computational biomechanical simulations that have been used to inform and develop a higher level of understanding of BHV tissues and their failure modes. Collectively, this information should serve as a tool not only to infer reliable and dependable prosthesis function, but also to instigate and facilitate the design of future bioprosthetic valves and clinically impact cardiology.},

  abstract   = {Thanks to minimally invasive procedures, frail and elderly patients can also benefit from innovative technologies. More than 14 million implanted pacemakers deliver impulses to the heart muscle to regulate the heart rate (treating bradycardias and blocks). The first human implantation of defibrillators was performed in early 2000. The defibrillator detects cardiac arrhythmias and corrects them by delivering electric shocks. The ongoing development of minimally invasive technologies has also broadened the scope of treatment for elderly patients with vascular stenosis and aneurysmal disease as well as other complex vascular pathologies. The nonsurgical cardiac valve replacement represents one of the most recent and exciting developments, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing a heart valve by way of placement through an intra-arterial or trans-ventricular sheath. Percutaneous devices are particularly well suited for the elderly as the surgical risks of minimally invasive surgery are considerably less as compared to open surgery, leading to a shorter hospital stay, a faster recovery, and improved quality of life.},

  abstract   = {The durability of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV) is severely limited by tissue deterioration, manifested as calcification and mechanical damage to the extracellular matrix. Extensive research on mineralization mechanisms has led to prevention strategies, but little work has been done on understanding the mechanisms of noncalcific matrix damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that calcification-independent damage to the valvular structural matrix mediated by mechanical factors occurs in clinical implants and could contribute to porcine aortic BHV structural failure. We correlated quantitative assessment of collagen fiber orientation and structural integrity by small angle light scattering (SALS) with morphologic analysis in 14 porcine aortic valve bioprostheses removed from patients for structural deterioration following 5-20 years of function. Calcification of the explants varied from 0 (none) to 1+ (minimal) to 4+ (extensive), as assessed radiographically. SALS tests were performed over entire excised cusps using a 0.254-mm spaced grid, and the resultant structural information used to generate maps of the local collagen fiber damage that were compared with sites of calcific deposits. All 42 cusps showed clear evidence of substantial noncalcific structural damage. In 29 cusps that were calcified, structural damage was consistently spatially distinct from the calcification deposits, generally in a distribution similar to that noted in porcine BHV subjected to in vitro durability testing. Our results suggest a mechanism of noncalcific degradation dependent on cuspal mechanics that could contribute to porcine aortic BHV failure.},

Less calcium deposition of BT-PEO-SO3 than of BT control was observed in in vivo tests. Such a reduced calcification of BT-PEO-SO3 can be explained by decreases of residual glutaraldehyde groups, a space filling effect and, therefore, improved biostability and synergistic blood-compatible effects of PEO and SO3 groups after the covalent binding of PEO-SO3 to tissue. This simple method can be a useful anti-calcification treatment for implantable tissue valves.},

This limited biological stability may be attributable to the inability of Glut to adequately protect certain tissue components such as elastin from enzymatic attack. The aim of our studies was to develop novel tissue-processing techniques targeted specifically at elastin stabilization by using tannic acid (TA), a plant polyphenol capable of protecting elastin from digestion by specific enzymes. In present studies we demonstrated that Glut does not adequately protect porcine aorta from elastase-mediated degradation in vitro. The addition of TA to the Glut fixation process increased the stability of Glut-fixed aorta to elastase digestion by 15-fold and also decreased calcification in the rat subdermal model by 66\%. TA was found to be chemically compatible with Glut fixation and did not hinder collagen crosslinking as shown by minor changes in thermal denaturation temperatures, resistance to collagenase and mechanical properties. In vitro and in vivo studies also revealed that TA binding to aortic wall was stable over an extended period of time. TA-mediated elastin stabilization in Glut-fixed cardiovascular implants may significantly extend the clinical durability of these tissue replacements.},

Our investigations studied ethanol pretreatment of glutaraldehyde cross-linked porcine aortic valves as a new approach to prevent cuspal calcification. The hypothesis governing this approach holds that ethanol pretreatment inhibits calcification resulting from protein structural alterations and lipid extraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Results demonstrated complete inhibition of calcification of glutaraldehyde-pretreated porcine bioprosthetic aortic valve cusps by 80.0\% ethanol in rat subdermal implants (60-day ethanol-pretreated calcium level, 1.87 +/- 0.29 micrograms/mg tissue compared with control calcium level, 236.00 +/- 6.10 micrograms/mg tissue) and in sheep mitral valve replacements (ethanol-pretreated calcium level, 5.22 +/- 2.94 micrograms/mg tissue; control calcium level, 32.50 +/- 11.50 micrograms/mg tissue). The mechanism of ethanol inhibition may be explained by several observations: ethanol pretreatment resulted in an irreversible alteration in the amide I band noted in the infrared spectra for both purified type I collagen and glutaraldehyde cross- linked porcine aortic leaflets. Ethanol pretreatment also resulted in nearly complete extraction of leaflet cholesterol and phospholipid. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol pretreatment of glutaraldehyde cross-linked porcine aortic valve bioprostheses represents a highly efficacious and mechanistically based approach and may prevent calcific bioprosthetic heart valve failure.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: In a previous study, we used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to reconstruct, three-dimensionally, porcine bioprosthetic heart valve (PBHV) cusp geometry. Initial results using three valves indicated that accelerated testing induced changes in cuspal shape, including focal regions of high curvature. Since for thin- walled shell structures, such as the PBHV cusp, curvature changes can affect the stress distribution independently from changes to mechanical properties, shape changes might have adverse effects on PBHV durability. METHODS: The MR technique was applied to an expanded valve database to explore more fully shape change with fatigue. The spatial curvature distribution was compared across valves subjected to a range of accelerated test times. RESULTS: Results confirmed our initial findings that PBHV cusps undergo a continuous, non-recoverable deformation with accelerated testing. This deformation resulted in an increase in the portion of cuspal surface exhibiting high curvature values. In one cusp we mapped structural information obtained by small- angle light scattering back to the three-dimensional cuspal surface using an interpolation technique. Results from the mapped cusp demonstrated a strong spatial correlation between elevated curvatures and structural damage. CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes in cuspal shape accelerate PBHV damage due to an increase in flexural strains induced by an increase in curvature reversal during operation, rather than an increase in tension during closure.},

For networks cross-linked in the undeformed state, the modulus increases linearly with the cross-link density as expected from rubber elasticity theory. When cross-links are added to a network that was uniaxially deformed, the stress remains constant in accordance with the independent network hypothesis of Tobolsky. When the deformed network is subsequently released, permanent set is observed. Using the independent network hypothesis, together with the affine theory of rubber elasticity, a constitutive model is developed that accounts for the effect of the coupling between the cross-link density and strain histories of the network. The permanent set predictions from the affine model are higher than found from MD simulations. },

The equilibrium stress is measured before and after removing some or all of the original (stage 1) cross-links. The results are interpreted in terms of a generalized independent network hypothesis. In networks where the first-stage cross-links are subsequently removed, a fraction (quantified by the stress transfer function Φ) of the second-stage cross-links contribute to the effective first-stage cross-link density. The stress transfer functions extracted from the MD simulations of the reacting networks are found to be in very good agreement with the predictions of Flory and Fricker. It was found that the fractional stress reduction upon removal of the first-stage cross-links could be accurately calculated from the slip tube model of Rubinstein and Panyukov modified to use the theoretical transfer functions of Fricker. },

Experimental methods to characterize tissue fatigue properties are complex and time-consuming. A constitutive fatigue model that could be calibrated by isolated material tests would be ideal for investigating the effects of more complex loading conditions. However, there is a lack of tissue fatigue damage models in the literature. To address these limitations, in this study, a phenomenological constitutive model was developed to describe the stress softening and permanent set effects of tissue subjected to long-term cyclic loading. The model was used to capture characteristic uniaxial fatigue data for glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium and was then implemented into finite element software. The simulated fatigue response agreed well with the experimental data and thus demonstrates feasibility of this approach.},

However, valve failure can occur within 12-15 years due to calcification and/or progressive degeneration. In this study, we have developed a novel fabrication method that utilizes carbodiimide, neomycin trisulfate, and pentagalloyl glucose crosslinking chemistry (TRI) to better stabilize the extracellular matrix of porcine aortic valve leaflets. We demonstrate that TRI treated leaflets show similar biomechanics to GLUT crosslinked leaflets. TRI treated leaflets had better resistance to enzymatic degradation in vitro and demonstrated better tearing toughness after challenged with enzymatic degradation. When implanted subcutaneously in rats for up to 90 days, GLUT control leaflets calcified heavily while TRI treated leaflets resisted calcification, retained more ECM components, and showed better biocompatibility.},

  abstract     = {Little is known about how valvular tissues grow and remodel in response to altered loading. In this work, we used the pregnancy state to represent a non-pathological cardiac volume overload that distends the mitral valve (MV), using both extant and new experimental data and a modified form of our MV structural constitutive model. We determined that there was an initial period of permanent set-like deformation where no remodelling occurs, followed by a remodelling phase that resulted in near-complete restoration of homeostatic tissue-level behaviour. In addition, we observed that changes in the underlying MV interstitial cell (MVIC) geometry closely paralleled the tissue-level remodelling events, undergoing an initial passive perturbation followed by a gradual recovery to the pre-pregnant state. Collectively, these results suggest that valvular remodelling is actively mediated by average MVIC deformations (i.e. not cycle to cycle, but over a period of weeks). Moreover, tissue-level remodelling is likely to be accomplished by serial and parallel additions of fibrillar material to restore the mean homeostatic fibre stress and MVIC geometries. This finding has significant implications in efforts to understand and predict MV growth and remodelling following such events as myocardial infarction and surgical repair, which also place the valve under altered loading conditions.},

Strain gages, electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) and digital image correlation (DIC) were used combined or separately to measure the strains in the central gauge area of a biaxially loaded cruciform composite specimen. Applicability of the technique for this specific test and accuracy of the results are important parameters in the evaluation process of the different strain measuring techniques. The results of the three techniques are compared with the results obtained with a 3D finite element (FE) model. It is shown that DIC is the most promising technique because of its full-field character and ability to cope with vibrations of the test bench. The main drawback remains its incapability to correlate across discontinuities.},

  abstract     = {Replacement with a prosthetic device remains a major treatment option for the patients suffering from heart valve disease, with prevalence growing resulting from an ageing population. While the most popular replacement heart valve continues to be the bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV), its durability remains limited. There is thus a continued need to develop a general understanding of the underlying mechanisms limiting BHV durability to facilitate development of a more durable prosthesis. In this regard, computational models can play a pivotal role as they can evaluate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and be used to optimize designs that may not always be intuitive. Areas covered: This review covers recent progress in computational models for the simulation of BHV, with a focus on aortic valve (AV) replacement. Recent contributions in valve geometry, leaflet material models, novel methods for numerical simulation, and applications to BHV optimization are discussed. This information should serve not only to infer reliable and dependable BHV function, but also to establish guidelines and insight for the design of future prosthetic valves by analyzing the influence of design, hemodynamics and tissue mechanics. Expert commentary: The paradigm of predictive modeling of heart valve prosthesis are becoming a reality which can simultaneously improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs. It can also lead to patient-specific valve design.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we develop a geometrically flexible technique for computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The motivating application is the simulation of tri-leaflet bioprosthetic heart valve function over the complete cardiac cycle. Due to the complex motion of the heart valve leaflets, the fluid domain undergoes large deformations, including changes of topology. The proposed method directly analyzes a spline-based surface representation of the structure by immersing it into a non-boundary-fitted discretization of the surrounding fluid domain. This places our method within an emerging class of computational techniques that aim to capture geometry on non-boundary-fitted analysis meshes. We introduce the term "immersogeometric analysis" to identify this paradigm. The framework starts with an augmented Lagrangian formulation for FSI that enforces kinematic constraints with a combination of Lagrange multipliers and penalty forces. For immersed volumetric objects, we formally eliminate the multiplier field by substituting a fluid-structure interface traction, arriving at Nitsche's method for enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on object surfaces. For immersed thin shell structures modeled geometrically as surfaces, the tractions from opposite sides cancel due to the continuity of the background fluid solution space, leaving a penalty method. Application to a bioprosthetic heart valve, where there is a large pressure jump across the leaflets, reveals shortcomings of the penalty approach. To counteract steep pressure gradients through the structure without the conditioning problems that accompany strong penalty forces, we resurrect the Lagrange multiplier field. Further, since the fluid discretization is not tailored to the structure geometry, there is a significant error in the approximation of pressure discontinuities across the shell. This error becomes especially troublesome in residual-based stabilized methods for incompressible flow, leading to problematic compressibility at practical levels of refinement. We modify existing stabilized methods to improve performance. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods, we test them on benchmark problems and compare the results with those of established boundary-fitted techniques. Finally, we simulate the coupling of the bioprosthetic heart valve and the surrounding blood flow under physiological conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in practical computations.},

  abstract   = {The wall shear stress induced by the leaflet motion during the valve-closing phase has been implicated with thrombus initiation with prosthetic valves. Detailed flow dynamic analysis in the vicinity of the leaflets and the housing during the valve-closure phase is of interest in understanding this relationship. A three-dimensional unsteady flow analysis past bileaflet valve prosthesis in the mitral position is presented incorporating a fluid-structure interaction algorithm for leaflet motion during the valve-closing phase. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method is employed for incorporating the leaflet motion. The forces exerted by the fluid on the leaflets are computed and applied to the leaflet equation of motion to predict the leaflet position. Relatively large velocities are computed in the valve clearance region between the valve housing and the leaflet edge with the resulting relatively large wall shear stresses at the leaflet edge during the impact-rebound duration. Negative pressure transients are computed on the surface of the leaflets on the atrial side of the valve, with larger magnitudes at the leaflet edge during the closing and rebound as well. Vortical flow development is observed on the inflow (atrial) side during the valve impact-rebound phase in a location central to the leaflet and away from the clearance region where cavitation bubbles have been visualized in previously reported experimental studies.},

  abstract     = {The function of right ventricle (RV) is recognized to play a key role in the development of many cardiopulmonary disorders, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Given the strong link between tissue structure and mechanical behavior, there remains a need for a myocardial constitutive model that accurately accounts for right ventricular myocardium architecture. Moreover, most available myocardial constitutive models approach myocardium at the length scale of mean fiber orientation and do not explicitly account for different fibrous constituents and possible interactions among them. In the present work, we developed a fiber-level constitutive model for the passive mechanical behavior of the right ventricular free wall (RVFW). The model explicitly separates the mechanical contributions of myofiber and collagen fiber ensembles, and accounts for the mechanical interactions between them. To obtain model parameters for the healthy passive RVFW, the model was informed by transmural orientation distribution measurements of myo- and collagen fibers and was fit to the mechanical testing data, where both sets of data were obtained from recent experimental studies on non-contractile, but viable, murine RVFW specimens. Results supported the hypothesis that in the low-strain regime, the behavior of the RVFW is governed by myofiber response alone, which does not demonstrate any coupling between different myofiber ensembles. At higher strains, the collagen fibers and their interactions with myofibers begin to gradually contribute and dominate the behavior as recruitment proceeds. Due to the use of viable myocardial tissue, the contribution of myofibers was significant at all strains with the predicted tensile modulus of [Formula: see text]32 kPa. This was in contrast to earlier reports (Horowitz et al. 1988) where the contribution of myofibers was found to be insignificant. Also, we found that the interaction between myo- and collagen fibers was greatest under equibiaxial strain, with its contribution to the total stress not exceeding 20 %. The present model can be applied to organ-level computational models of right ventricular dysfunction for efficient diagnosis and evaluation of pulmonary hypertension disorder.},

  abstract   = {Mechanical conditioning of engineered tissue constructs is widely recognized as one of the most relevant methods to enhance tissue accretion and microstructure, leading to improved mechanical behaviors. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains rather limited, restricting the development of in silico models of these phenomena, and the translation of engineered tissues into clinical application. In the present study, we examined the role of large strip-biaxial strains (up to 50\%) on ECM synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) micro-integrated into electrospun polyester urethane urea (PEUU) constructs over the course of 3 weeks. Experimental results indicated that VSMC biosynthetic behavior was quite sensitive to tissue strain maximum level, and that collagen was the primary ECM component synthesized. Moreover, we found that while a 30\% peak strain level achieved maximum ECM synthesis rate, further increases in strain level lead to a reduction in ECM biosynthesis. Subsequent mechanical analysis of the formed collagen fiber network was performed by removing the scaffold mechanical responses using a strain-energy based approach, showing that the denovo collagen also demonstrated mechanical behaviors substantially better than previously obtained with small strain training and comparable to mature collagenous tissues. We conclude that the application of large deformations can play a critical role not only in the quantity of ECM synthesis (i.e. the rate of mass production), but also on the modulation of the stiffness of the newly formed ECM constituents. The improved understanding of the process of growth and development of ECM in these mechano-sensitive cell-scaffold systems will lead to more rational design and manufacturing of engineered tissues operating under highly demanding mechanical environments.},

It is applied to a structural model with a variety of constitutive equations and test protocols, and for a wide range of parameter levels. The results show nearly identical optimal designs under all circumstances. Optimality is obtained with two uniaxial stretch tests at mutually normal directions inclined by 22.5 deg to the axes of material symmetry. Protocols which include additional equibiaxial tests provide superior estimation with lower variance of estimates. Tests performed at angles 0, 45, and 90 deg to the axes of material symmetry provide unreliable estimates. The optimal sampling is variable and depends on the protocols and model parameters. In conclusion, the results indicate that biaxial tests can be improved over presently common procedures and show that this conclusion applies for a variety of circumstances.},

  abstract  = {New experimental results on collagen fibre dispersion in human arterial layers have shown that the dispersion in the tangential plane is more significant than that out of plane. A rotationally symmetric dispersion model is not able to capture this distinction. For this reason, we introduce a new non-symmetric dispersion model, based on the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is used to construct a new structure tensor. The latter is incorporated in a strain-energy function that accommodates both the mechanical and structural features of the material, extending our rotationally symmetric dispersion model (Gasser et al. 2006 J. R. Soc. Interface 3, 15{\textendash}35. (doi:10.1098/rsif.2005.0073)). We provide specific ranges for the dispersion parameters and show how previous models can be deduced as special cases. We also provide explicit expressions for the stress and elasticity tensors in the Lagrangian description that are needed for a finite-element implementation. Material and structural parameters were obtained by fitting predictions of the model to experimental data obtained from human abdominal aortic adventitia. In a finite-element example, we analyse the influence of the fibre dispersion on the homogeneous biaxial mechanical response of aortic strips, and in a final example the non-homogeneous stress distribution is obtained for circumferential and axial strips under fixed extension. It has recently become apparent that this more general model is needed for describing the mechanical behaviour of a variety of fibrous tissues.},

  abstract   = {Hypertension results in a thickening of the arterial wall due to a net increase in wall constituents via a coordinated production and removal of smooth muscle and extracellular matrix. Although many reports address the associated changes in material properties, few models address the biomechanics of the growth and remodeling process. In this paper, we employ a new, fundamentally different approach to modeling arterial adaptation in hypertension. In particular, basic, characteristic features of hypertension are simulated using a constrained mixture model wherein individual constituents can turnover at different rates and can have different natural configurations. We show, for example, that if there is no turnover of elastin (which approximates responses in maturity), the model vessel is able to reduce an early elevation in wall stress via a thickening of the wall even though the adaptation may be suboptimal. Conversely, if all constituents can turnover completely (which may approximate late development), the model vessel can restore the state of stress and material properties to native values. Given the potential of such a model, there is a need for more data on the history of turnover of individual constituents and their individual material properties.},

  abstract   = {Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in soft elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stress-dependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},

Many previous algorithms applied standard 2D tracking methods to tackle the 3D problem. However, the performance is limited due to increased data size, landmarks ambiguity, signal drop-out or non-rigid deformation. In this paper we present a robust, fast and accurate 3D LV tracking algorithm. We propose a novel one-step forward prediction to generate the motion prior using motion manifold learning, and introduce two collaborative trackers to achieve both temporal consistency and failure recovery. Compared with tracking by detection and 3D optical flow, our algorithm provides the best results and sub-voxel accuracy. The new tracking algorithm is completely automatic and computationally efficient. It requires less than 1.5 seconds to process a 3D volume which contains 4,925,440 voxels.},

  abstract     = {Formation of engineering tissues (ET) remains an important scientific area of investigation for both clinical translational and mechanobiological studies. Needled-nonwoven (NNW) scaffolds represent one of the most ubiquitous biomaterials based on their well-documented capacity to sustain tissue formation and the unique property of substantial construct stiffness amplification, the latter allowing for very sensitive determination of forming tissue modulus. Yet, their use in more fundamental studies is hampered by the lack of: (1) substantial understanding of the mechanics of the NNW scaffold itself under finite deformations and means to model the complex mechanical interactions between scaffold fibers, cells, and de novo tissue; and (2) rational models with reliable predictive capabilities describing their evolving mechanical properties and their response to mechanical stimulation. Our objective is to quantify the mechanical properties of the forming ET phase in constructs that utilize NNW scaffolds. We present herein a novel mathematical model to quantify their stiffness based on explicit considerations of the modulation of NNW scaffold fiber-fiber interactions and effective fiber stiffness by surrounding de novo ECM. Specifically, fibers in NNW scaffolds are effectively stiffer than if acting alone due to extensive fiber-fiber cross-over points that impart changes in fiber geometry, particularly crimp wavelength and amplitude. Fiber-fiber interactions in NNW scaffolds also play significant role in the bulk anisotropy of the material, mainly due to fiber buckling and large translational out-of-plane displacements occurring to fibers undergoing contraction. To calibrate the model parameters, we mechanically tested impregnated NNW scaffolds with polyacrylamide (PAM) gels with a wide range of moduli with values chosen to mimic the effects of surrounding tissues on the scaffold fiber network. Results indicated a high degree of model fidelity over a wide range of planar strains. Lastly, we illustrated the impact of our modeling approach quantifying the stiffness of engineered ECM after in vitro incubation and early stages of in vivo implantation obtained in a concurrent study of engineered tissue pulmonary valves in an ovine model. Regenerative medicine has the potential to fully restore diseased tissues or entire organs with engineered tissues. Needled-nonwoven scaffolds can be employed to serve as the support for their growth. However, there is a lack of understanding of the mechanics of these materials and their interactions with the forming tissues. We developed a mathematical model for these scaffold-tissue composites to quantify the mechanical properties of the forming tissues. Firstly, these measurements are pivotal to achieve functional requirements for tissue engineering implants; however, the theoretical development yielded critical insight into particular mechanisms and behaviors of these scaffolds that were not possible to conjecture without the insight given by modeling, let alone describe or foresee a priori.},

  abstract        = {Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs), fabricated from exogenously crosslinked collagenous tissues, remain the most popular heart valve replacement design. However, the life span of BHVs remains limited to 10-15 years, in part because the mechanisms that underlie BHV failure remain poorly understood. Experimental evidence indicates that BHVs undergo significant changes in geometry with in vivo operation, which lead to stress concentrations that can have significant impact on structural damage. These changes do not appear to be due to plastic deformation, as the leaflets only deform in the elastic regime. Moreover, structural damage was not detected by the 65 million cycle time point. Instead, we found that this nonrecoverable deformation is similar to the permanent set effect observed in elastomers, which allows the reference configuration of the material to evolve over time. We hypothesize that the scission-healing reaction of glutaraldehyde is the underlying mechanism responsible for permanent set in exogenously crosslinked soft tissues. The continuous scission-healing process of glutaraldehyde allows a portion of the exogenously crosslinked matrix, which is considered to be the non-fibrous part of the extra-cellular matrix, to be re-crosslinked in the loaded state. Thus, this mechanism for permanent set can be used to explain the time evolving mechanical response and geometry of BHVs in the early stage. To model the permanent set effect, we assume that the exogenously crosslinked matrix undergoes changes in reference configurations over time. The changes in the collagen fiber architecture due to dimensional changes allow us to predict subsequent changes in mechanical response. Results show that permanent set alone can explain and, more importantly, predict how the mechanical response of the biomaterial change with time. Furthermore, we found is no difference in permanent set rate constants between the strain controlled and the stress controlled cyclic loading studies. An important finding we have is that the collagen fiber architecture has a limiting effect on the maximum changes in geometry that the permanent set effect can induce. This is due to the recruitment of collagen fibers as the changes in geometry due to permanent set increase. This means we can potentially optimize the BHV geometry based on the predicted the final BHV geometry after permanent set has largely ceased. Thus, we have developed the first structural constitutive model for the permanent set effect in exogenously crosslinked soft tissue, which can help to simulate BHV designs and reduce changes in BHV geometry during cyclic loading and thus potentially increasing BHV durability.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using this optical method to detect quantitative differences in PAV collagen crimp following zero-, low-, and high- pressure fixation. The results of this study demonstrate the following: 1) coupling polarized light microscopy and morphometric measurements provides a quantitative method for the evaluation of the relationship between fixation pressure and collagen crimp in PAVs; 2) a significant association between increasing fixation pressure and absence of collagen crimp was observed in cords and the mid-cusp region; 3) collagen crimp length in the cords is affected by fixation pressure; 4) the alteration of collagen crimp by low- and high-pressure fixation does not uniformly affect all regions of the cusp; and, 5) collagen crimp was consistently present in all cusp regions in zero-pressure fixed PAVs.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Defects in the pulmonary valve (PV) occur in a variety of forms of congenital heart diseases. Quantitative information on PV collagen fiber architecture, and particularly its response to diastolic forces, is necessary for the design and functional assessment of approaches for PV repair and replacement. This necessity is especially the case for novel tissue-engineered PV, which rely on extensive in-vivo remodeling for long-term function. METHODS: Porcine PV and aortic valves (AV) were fixed under a 0 to 90 mm Hg transvalvular pressure. After dissection from the root, small-angle light-scattering measurements were conducted to quantify the collagen fiber architecture and changes with increasing applied transvalvular pressure over the entire cusp. Histomorphologic measurements were also performed to assess changes in cuspal layer thickness with pressure. RESULTS: While the PV and AV displayed anticipated structural similarities, they also presented important functionally related differences. In the unloaded state, the AV cusp demonstrated substantial regional variations in fiber alignment, whereas the PV was surprisingly uniform. Further, the AV demonstrated substantially larger changes in collagen fiber alignment with applied transvalvular pressure compared with the PV. Overall, the AV collagen fiber network demonstrated greater ability to respond to applied transvalvular pressure. A decrease in crimp amplitude was the predominant mechanism for improvement in the degree of orientation of the collagen fibers in both valves. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the major similarities and differences between the PV and the AV. While underscoring how the PV can serve as an appropriate replacement of the diseased AV, the observed structural differences may also indicate limits to the ability of the PV to fully duplicate the AV. Moreover, quantitative data from this study on PV functional architecture will benefit development of tissue-engineered PV by defining the critical fiber architectural characteristics.},

The 36 leaflets tested were removed from 18 unimplanted cryopreserved aortic allograft valves retrieved from donors aged 15 to 58 years. The stretch was measured at a traction of 60 Nm-1 and analyzed as a function of the age of the donor. It was found that at 15 years, the radial stretch is about 80\% but declines rapidly (linearized rate of 4\% per year) to be 40\% by the age of 25 years. The stretch stays approximately constant until the age of 40 years and then undergoes a steady decline at the rate of about 1\% per year at least until the age of 58 years. These results demonstrate that stretch, which is important for the maintenance of adequate coaptation area, is not permanent but may be lost at a relatively rapid rate for reasons that are not yet understood. Stretch loss in the leaflets also must be a contributing factor to the development of aortic incompetence. The probability of postoperative stretch loss needs to be allowed for in sizing protocols for aortic allografts.},

  abstract   = {It has been speculated that heart valve interstitial cells (VICs) maintain valvular tissue homeostasis through regulated extracellular matrix (primarily collagen) biosynthesis. VICs appear to be phenotypically plastic, inasmuch as they transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts during valve development, disease, and remodeling. Under normal physiological conditions, transvalvular pressures (TVPs) on the right and left side of the heart are vastly different. Hence, we hypothesize that higher left-side TVPs impose larger local tissue stress on VICs, which increases their stiffness through cytoskeletal composition, and that this relation affects collagen biosynthesis. To evaluate this hypothesis, isolated ovine VICs from the four heart valves were subjected to micropipette aspiration to assess cellular stiffness, and cytoskeletal composition and collagen biosynthesis were quantified by using the surrogates smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), respectively. VICs from the aortic and mitral valves were significantly stiffer (P {\textless} 0.001) than those from the pulmonary and tricuspid valves. Left-side isolated VICs contained significantly more (P {\textless} 0.001) SMA and HSP47 than right-side VICs. Mean VIC stiffness correlated well (r = 0.973) with TVP; SMA and HSP47 also correlated well (r = 0.996) with one another. Assays were repeated for VICs in situ, and, as with in vitro results, left-side VIC protein levels were significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.05). These findings suggest that VICs respond to local tissue stress by altering cellular stiffness (through SMA content) and collagen biosynthesis. This functional VIC stress-dependent biosynthetic relation may be crucial in maintaining valvular tissue homeostasis and also prove useful in understanding valvular pathologies.},

METHODS: Whole porcine aortic valves were pressurized and the induced strain patterns measured on aortic valve cusps and roots. Measurements were made before and after trimming of excess ventricular muscle and mitral valve tissue. RESULTS: Negative (compressive) radial strains were found only in the NC cusp. Trimming of surrounding muscle increased the magnitude of both the tensile circumferential strains and compressive radial strains in the NC cusp. The left and right coronary cusps (LC, RC respectively) had similar positive radial and circumferential strains, and trimming had inconsistent effects on the strain patterns. Trimming of the aortic root increased root strains adjacent to the NC cusp, thus increasing positive circumferential strains and negative radial strains in the NC cusp. Analysis of images obtained during loading indicated that a wrinkle formed at the base of the NC cusp in 66\% of cases in which negative strains were observed. CONCLUSION: Negative radial strains were induced in the NC cusp as it stretched circumferentially during static pressurization. In many valves, negative strains resulted from radial folding or wrinkling of the valve cusp. Since the RC and LC cusps had circumferential and radial strains that were not similar to those of the NC cusp, it is likely that the NC cusp has a different internal fibrous organization.},

  abstract   = {Abstract-The mitral valve (MV) is a complex anatomical structure whose function involves a delicate force balance and synchronized function of each of its components. Elucidation of the role of each component and their interactions is critical to improving our understanding of MV function, and to form the basis for rational surgical repair. In the present study, we present the first known detailed study of the surface strains in the anterior leaflet in the functioning MV. The three-dimensional spatial positions of markers placed in the central region of the MV anterior leaflet in a left ventricle-simulating flow loop over the cardiac cycle were determined. The resulting two-dimensional in-surface strain tensor was computed from the marker positions using a C0 Lagrangian quadratic finite element. Results demonstrated that during valve closure the anterior leaflet experienced large, anisotropic strains with peak stretch rates of 500\%-1,000\%/s. This rapid stretching was followed by a plateau phase characterized by relatively constant strain state. We hypothesized that the presence of this plateau phase was a result of full straightening of the leaflet collagen fibers upon valve closure. This hypothesis suggests that the MV collagen fibers are designed to allow leaflet coaptation followed by a dramatic increase in stiffness to prevent further leaflet deformation, which would lead to valvular regurgitation. These studies represent a first step in improving our understanding of normal MV function and to help establish the principles for repair and replacement.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to develop a quantitative method for tracking the three-dimensional geometry of the mitral valve. The second was to determine the complex interrelationships of various components of the mitral valve in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen sonomicrometry transducers were placed around the mitral vale anulus, at the tips and bases of both papillary muscles, at the ventricular apex, across the ventricular epicardial short axis, and on the anterior chest wall before and during cardiopulmonary bypass in eight anesthetized sheep. Animals were studied later on 17 occasions. Reproducibility of derived chord lengths and three-dimensional coordinates from sonomicrometry array localization, longevity of transducer signals, and the dynamics of the mitral valve and left ventricle were studied. Reproducibility of distance measurements averages 1.6\%; Procrustes analysis of three-dimensional arrays of coordinate locations predicts an average error of 2.2 mm. Duration of serial sonomicrometry array localization signals ranges between 60 and 151 days (mean 114 days). Sonomicrometry array localization demonstrates the saddle-shaped mitral anulus, its minimal orifice area immediately before end-diastole, and uneven, apical descent during systole. Papillary muscles shorten only 3.0 to 3.5 mm. Sonomicrometry array localization demonstrates nonuniform torsion of papillary muscle transducers around a longitudinal axis and shows rotation of papillary muscular bases toward each other during systole. CONCLUSION: Tagging of ventricular structures in experimental animals by sonomicrometry array localization images is highly reproducible and suitable for serial observations. In sheep the method provides unique, quantitative information regarding the interrelationship of mitral valvular and left ventricular structures throughout the cardiac cycle.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: The mitral valve annulus has a distinctive saddle shape. Recent finite element analysis indicates this shape may contribute to normal valve function by increasing leaflet curvature and reducing leaflet stress. This study tests the hypothesis that acute ischemic mitral regurgitation (AIMR) is associated with loss of annular saddle shape. METHODS: Sonomicrometry array localization (SAL) measured the three-dimensional geometry of the mitral annulus in 6 sheep before and after 30 min of posterior ischemia that produced severe AIMR. Using this SAL data the annular height to commissural width ratio (AHCWR), a measure of annular saddle shape, was calculated throughout the cardiac cycle and reported as a percentage. RESULTS: The normal mitral annulus accentuated its saddle shape rapidly during isovolemic contraction: AHCWR increased from 11.6\% +/- 1.1\%-13.9\% +/- 1.6\% (p {\textless} 0.001). During ejection AHCWR remained relatively constant ranging from a minimum of 14.1\% +/- 1.5\% to a maximum of 14.9\% +/- 1.3\%. During ischemia AHCWR was found to be significantly smaller (p {\textless} 0.05) during isovolemic contraction, ejection, and isovolemic relaxation, but not during diastolic filling. Whereas ischemia did not affect AHCWR at end diastole (11.6\% +/- 2.8\%), the isovolemic accentuation of the saddle shape was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The normal mitral annulus accentuates its saddle shape during systole. This accentuation is eliminated during ischemia that causes AIMR. These data suggest an association between annular saddle shape and valve competency.},

One third of our elderly have echocardiographic or radiological evidence of calcific aortic valve sclerosis, an early and subclinical form of CAVD. Age, sex, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus all contribute to the risk of disease that has worldwide distribution. On progression to its most severe form, calcific aortic stenosis, CAVD becomes debilitating and devastating, and 2\% of individuals {\textgreater}60 years are affected by calcific aortic stenosis to the extent that surgical intervention is required. No effective pharmacotherapies exist for treating those at risk for clinical progression. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a diverse spectrum of cellular and molecular mechanisms converge to regulate valvular calcium load; this is evidenced not only in histopathologic heterogeneity of CAVD, but also from the multiplicity of cell types that can participate in valve biomineralization. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of CAVD disease biology, emphasizing molecular and cellular aspects of its regulation. We end by pointing to important biological and clinical questions that must be answered to enable sophisticated disease staging and the development of new strategies to treat CAVD medically.},

  abstract   = {Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common acquired valvular disorder in developed countries. CAVD ranges from mild thickening of the valve, known as aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc), to severe impairment of the valve motion, which is termed aortic valve stenosis (AVS). The prevalence of CAVD is nearing epidemic status: its preceding stage, in which there is aortic sclerosis without obstruction of the left ventricular outflow, is present in almost 30\% of adults aged over 65 years. As there is no existing medical therapy to treat or slow the progression of CAVD, surgery for advanced disease represents the only available treatment. Aortic valve replacement is the second most frequently performed cardiac surgical procedure after coronary artery bypass grafting, and consequently CAVD represents a major societal and economic burden. The pathophysiological development of CAVD is incompletely defined. At the present time, the major methods for its diagnosis are clinical examination, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization. Yet, due to the multiple biological pathways leading to CAVD, there are many potential biomarkers that might be suitable for deriving clinically useful information regarding the presence, severity, progression, and prognosis of CAVD. Although at the present time the available data do not permit recommendations for clinicians, they do support a paradigm of screening patients based on multiple biomarkers to provide the information necessary to optimize future therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes the results of several studies investigating the value of potential biomarkers that have been used to predict the severity, progression, and prognosis of CAVD.},

  abstract   = {AIMS: Aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc) is a hallmark of several cardiovascular conditions ranging from chronic heart failure and myocardial infarction to calcific aortic valve stenosis (AVS). AVSc, present in 25-30\% of patients over 65 years of age, is characterized by thickening of the leaflets with marginal effects on the mechanical proprieties of the valve making its presentation asymptomatic. Despite its clinical prevalence, few studies have investigated the pathogenesis of this disease using human AVSc specimens. Here, we investigate in vitro and ex vivo BMP4-mediated transdifferentiation of human valve interstitial cells (VICs) towards an osteogenic-like phenotype in AVSc. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human specimens from 60 patients were collected at the time of aortic valve replacement (AVS) or through the heart transplant programme (Controls and AVSc). We show that non-calcified leaflets from AVSc patients can be induced to express markers of osteogenic transdifferentiation and biomineralization through the combinatory effect of BMP4 and mechanical stimulation. We show that BMP4 antagonist Noggin attenuates VIC activation and biomineralization. Additionally, patient-derived VICs were induced to transdifferentiate using either cell culture or a Tissue Engineering (TE) Aortic Valve model. We determine that while BMP4 alone is not sufficient to induce osteogenic transdifferentiation of AVSc-derived cells, the combinatory effect of BMP4 and mechanical stretch induces VIC activation towards a phenotype typical of late calcified stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates, for the first time using AVSc specimens, that human sclerotic aortic valves can be induced to express marker of osteogenic-like phenotype typical of advanced severe aortic stenosis.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common cause of acquired valve disease. Initial phases of CAVD include thickening of the cusps, whereas advanced stages are associated with biomineralization and reduction of the aortic valve area. These conditions are known as aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc) and aortic valve stenosis (AVS), respectively. Because of its asymptomatic presentation, little is known about the molecular determinants of AVSc. The aim of this study was to correlate plasma and tissue osteopontin (OPN) levels with echocardiographic evaluation for the identification of asymptomatic patients at risk for CAVD. In addition, our aim was to analyze the differential expression and biological function of OPN splicing variants as biomarkers of early and late stages of CAVD. METHODS: From January 2010 to February 2011, 310 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) evaluation: controls (56 patients), AVSc (90 patients), and AVS (164 patients). Plasma and tissue OPN levels were measured by immunohistochemical evaluation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Patients with AVSc and AVS have higher OPN levels compared with controls. OPN levels are elevated in asymptomatic patients with AVSc with no appearance of calcification during TEE evaluation. OPN splicing variants OPN-a, OPN-b, and OPN-c are differentially expressed during CAVD progression and are able to inhibit biomineralization in a cell-based biomineralization assay. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the differential expression of OPN splicing variants during CAVD may help in developing diagnostic and risk stratification tools to follow the progression of asymptomatic aortic valve degeneration.},

  abstract   = {The presence of aortic valve sclerosis has been suggested as a marker of increased cardiovascular risk, including increased mortality. However, it remains unclear whether aortic valve sclerosis is independently associated with risk or merely a marker of coexistent cardiovascular risk factors. Aortic valve sclerosis is usually diagnosed on transthoracic echocardiography, the most widely used imaging modality in observational and natural history studies of aortic valve disease. Defining aortic valve sclerosis has remained challenging due to the variable and qualitative nature of its description by ultrasound techniques. Importantly, artifacts common to ultrasound imaging and awareness of demographic and clinical history information may bias the diagnosis of aortic valve sclerosis. Because clinicians may alter treatment recommendations or follow-up based on echocardiographic reporting of aortic valve sclerosis, highlighting pitfalls of the subjective nature by which aortic valve sclerosis is identified and establishing diagnostic criteria are necessary. This review describes the diagnostic criteria for aortic valve sclerosis used in outcome studies, summarizes the epidemiological findings reporting the relationship between aortic valve sclerosis and clinical outcome, and proposes a definition of aortic valve sclerosis based on the literature.},

  abstract   = {As populations in Western civilizations are aging, the prevalence of degenerative aortic valve stenosis is increasing. CT imaging provides information on aortic valve pathology in many ways: In nonenhanced scans, aortic valve calcification can be quantified accurately, which helps to understand the pathogenesis and progression of aortic sclerosis and stenosis. After contrast injection, CT allows excellent visualization of aortic valve structure and, through measurement of the aortic valve area, is capable to serve as a "backup method" for the assessment of aortic valve stenosis, especially if other imaging methods are difficult to interpret. Importantly, CT tends to overestimate aortic valve opening areas in comparison to transthoracic echocardiography, which relies on the continuity equation for quantifying aortic stenosis, based on flow velocities and the estimated area of the left ventricular outflow tract. It has recently been shown that the oval rather than round shape of the left ventricular outflow tract is the most likely factor behind this systematic difference between functional compared with anatomic assessment of aortic valve stenosis. In fact, the ability to provide superbly accurate anatomic imaging of the aortic valve and entire aortic root makes CT a uniquely useful tool for the planning of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Hence, CT imaging spans a wide range of applications in aortic valve disease, from basic research to diagnosis and treatment planning. This review aims to summarize the current state of the art concerning imaging of the aortic valve by CT and the potential clinical applications.},

The ability of echocardiography to provide early diagnosis and an accurate measurement of disease severity has increased our knowledge of the natural history of this disease process and allows us to follow individual patients over time, long before valve replacement is needed. We now recognize that even mild symptoms are an indication for valve replacement when severe obstruction is present. This review discusses the optimal approach to measurement of disease severity, the presymptomatic disease course, and the underlying causes of calcific valve disease, followed by a summary of clinical trials of medical therapy and the current indications and choices for valve replacement.},

  abstract   = {CONTEXT: It is not known whether statin treatment improves clinical outcomes and reduces aortic stenosis progression in non-rheumatic calcific aortic stenosis. OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of studies was performed comparing statin therapy with placebo or no treatment on outcomes and on aortic stenosis progression echocardiographic parameters. DATA SOURCES: The authors searched Medline and Pubmed up to January 2010. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers independently abstracted information on study design (prospective vs retrospective or randomised vs non-randomised), study and participant characteristics. Fixed and random effects models were used. A-priori subanalyses assessed the effect of statins on low-quality (retrospective or non-randomised) and on high-quality (prospective or randomised) studies separately. RESULTS: Meta-analysis identified 10 studies with a total of 3822 participants (2214 non-statin-treated and 1608 statin-treated); five studies were classified as prospective and five as retrospective; concerning randomisation, three trials were randomised whereas seven were not. No significant differences were found in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or in the need for aortic valve surgery. Lower-quality (retrospective or non-randomised) studies showed that, in statin-treated patients, the annual increase in peak aortic jet velocity and the annual decrease in aortic valve area were lower, but this was not confirmed by the analysis in high-quality (prospective or randomised) studies. Statins did not significantly affect the progression over time of peak and mean aortic gradient. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data do not support the use of statins to improve outcomes and to reduce disease progression in non-rheumatic calcific aortic valve stenosis.},

BACKGROUND: Recent retrospective studies support the hypothesis that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis. METHODS: We performed an open-label, prospective study evaluating 121 consecutive patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area {\textgreater} or = 1.0 cm2; mean age 73.7 +/- 8.9 years; 57 men and 64 women), treated with and without rosuvastatin according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Echocardiographic, serum lipid, and inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 18 months. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (50.4\%) with elevated LDL (159.7 +/- 33.4 mg/dl), aortic valve velocity (3.65 +/- 0.64 m/s), and aortic valve area (1.23 +/- 0.42 cm2) received rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), and 60 (49.6\%) with a normal LDL (118.6 +/- 37.4 mg/dl), aortic valve velocity (3.62 +/- 0.61 m/s), and aortic valve area (1.20 +/- 0.35 cm2) received no statin. During a mean follow-up of 73 +/- 24 weeks, the change in aortic valve area in the control group was -0.10 +/- 0.09 cm2/year versus -0.05 +/- 0.12 cm2/year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.041). The increase in aortic valve velocity was 0.24 +/- 0.30 m/s/year in the control group and 0.04 +/- 0.38 m/s/year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.007). There was significant improvement in serum lipid and echocardiographic measures of aortic stenosis in the statin group. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective treatment of aortic stenosis with rosuvastatin by targeting serum LDL slowed the hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis. This is the first prospective study that shows a positive effect of statin therapy for this disease process.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic stenosis has many characteristics in common with atherosclerosis, including hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesized that intensive lipid-lowering therapy would halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with calcific aortic stenosis were randomly assigned to receive either 80 mg of atorvastatin daily or a matched placebo. Aortic-valve stenosis and calcification were assessed with the use of Doppler echocardiography and helical computed tomography, respectively. The primary end points were change in aortic-jet velocity and aortic-valve calcium score. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were assigned to atorvastatin and 78 to placebo, with a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 7 to 36). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations remained at 130+/-30 mg per deciliter in the placebo group and fell to 63+/-23 mg per deciliter in the atorvastatin group (P{\textless}0.001). Increases in aortic-jet velocity were 0.199+/-0.210 m per second per year in the atorvastatin group and 0.203+/-0.208 m per second per year in the placebo group (P=0.95; adjusted mean difference, 0.002; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.066 to 0.070 m per second per year). Progression in valvular calcification was 22.3+/-21.0 percent per year in the atorvastatin group, and 21.7+/-19.8 percent per year in the placebo group (P=0.93; ratio of post-treatment aortic-valve calcium score, 0.998; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.947 to 1.050). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive lipid-lowering therapy does not halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression. This study cannot exclude a small reduction in the rate of disease progression or a significant reduction in major clinical end points. Long-term, large-scale, randomized, controlled trials are needed to establish the role of statin therapy in patients with calcific aortic stenosis.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: Calcific aortic stenosis, characterized by excessive fibrosis and deposition of bone-like calcified tissue, affects roughly 2\% to 3\% of the U.S. population over the age of 65. Recent studies have suggested that statins have a positive effect on the progression of aoritic stenosis, likely because of their ability to affect the resident cell population, known as valvular interstitial cells (VICs). VICs are fibroblastic cells that can differentiate to form activated myofibroblasts, displaying increased alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression, contractility, and collagen production. METHODS AND RESULTS: In culture, VICs spontaneously form multicellular aggregates that subsequently develop into calcified nodules, providing an in vitro model for aortic stenosis. Using real-time microscopic tracking, we observed that confluent VIC monolayers spontaneously contract into rounded nodules, suggesting that myofibroblastic contractility is a critical step in the process of nodule formation. Overexpression of alphaSMA increased VIC calcific nodule formation and contractility, whereas knockdown of alphaSMA with siRNAs reduced these phenotypes, suggesting that the expression and contractile properties of alphaSMA are essential to the formation of nodules. Statin treatment of VICs reduced alphaSMA expression, inhibited contractility, and decreased nodule formation. When statins were used to treat preformed nodules, no decrease in the number of calcified nodules was observed, suggesting that statins may play more of a preventative role in aortic stenosis than a cure. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence of a causal relationship between VIC myofibroblastic activity and initial VIC calcific nodule formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pravastatin inhibition of calcific nodule formation is related to inhibition of myofibroblastic activity.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia has been suggested as a risk factor for stenosis of the aortic valve, but lipid-lowering studies have had conflicting results. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 1873 patients with mild-to-moderate, asymptomatic aortic stenosis. The patients received either 40 mg of simvastatin plus 10 mg of ezetimibe or placebo daily. The primary outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including death from cardiovascular causes, aortic-valve replacement, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, coronary-artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, and nonhemorrhagic stroke. Secondary outcomes were events related to aortic-valve stenosis and ischemic cardiovascular events. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 52.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 333 patients (35.3\%) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group and in 355 patients (38.2\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.12; P=0.59). Aortic-valve replacement was performed in 267 patients (28.3\%) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group and in 278 patients (29.9\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 1.18; P=0.97). Fewer patients had ischemic cardiovascular events in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group (148 patients) than in the placebo group (187 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.97; P=0.02), mainly because of the smaller number of patients who underwent coronary-artery bypass grafting. Cancer occurred more frequently in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group (105 vs. 70, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin and ezetimibe did not reduce the composite outcome of combined aortic-valve events and ischemic events in patients with aortic stenosis. Such therapy reduced the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events but not events related to aortic-valve stenosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00092677.)},

Fresh porcine aortic valves were fixed at transvalvular pressures ranging from 0 mmHg to 90 mmHg, and small-angle light scattering (SALS) was used to quantify the gross fiber structure of the valve cusps. At all pressures the fiber-preferred directions coursed along the circumferential direction. Increasing transvalvular pressure induced the greatest changes in fiber alignment between 0 and 1 mmHg, with no detectable change past 4 mmHg. When the fibrosa and ventricularis layers of the cusps were re-scanned separately, the fibrosa layer revealed a higher degree of orientation while the ventricularis was more randomly oriented. The degree of fiber orientation for both layers became more similar once the transvalvular pressure exceeded 4 mmHg, and the layers were almost indistinguishable by 60 mmHg. It is possible that, in addition to retracting the aortic cusp during systole, the ventricularis mechanically may contribute to the diastolic cuspal stiffness at high transvalvular pressures, which may help to prevent over distention of the cusp. Our results suggest a complex, highly heterogeneous structural response to transvalvular pressure on a fiber level that will have to be duplicated in future bioprosthetic heart valve designs.},

  abstract   = {Calcification is the principal cause of failure of tissue-derived cardiac valve replacements pretreated with glutaraldehyde (GLUT). The objective of this study was to determine the role of GLUT-induced cross- links in bovine pericardial tissue calcification. Various levels of 3H- GLUT incorporation were obtained by varying incubation pH, and protein modification was determined by amino acid analysis and resistance to collagenase digestion. Calcification of cross-linked tissue was studied using subdermal implants in rats. Low GLUT uptake (less than 150 nm/mg) resulted in minimal calcification (Ca2+, 12.8 micrograms/mg) and stability (4\% residual weight following digestion) due to a limited crosslinking (lysine + hydroxylysine = 26.1 residues/1000 amino acids [AA]). In contrast, higher GLUT uptake induced more cross-links (Lys + Hyl = 8.2 residues/1000 AA) and consequent higher stability (95\% residual wt); such tissues calcified severely (Ca2+, 93.5 micrograms/mg). Incorporation of GLUT two to three times beyond a critical level did not further enhance calcification. It is concluded that the amount of GLUT incorporated controls the extent of cross- links, which in turn directly determines tissue stability and calcification.},

  abstract   = {Functional tissue engineering of load-bearing repair tissues requires the design and production of biomaterials that provide a remodelable scaffold for host infiltration and tissue regeneration while maintaining the repair function throughout the remodeling process. Layered constructs have been fabricated from chemically and mechanically cleaned porcine intestinal collagen using ethyl-3(3-dimethylamino) propyl carbodiimide (EDC) and an acetone solvent. By varying the concentration of the crosslinker from 1 to 10 mM and the solvent from 0 to 90\% acetone, the strength, stiffness, maximum strain, thermal stability, lamination strength, and suture retention strength can be adjusted. These parameters have either functional importance or the potential to modify the remodeling kinetics, or they have both. This study investigates the interdependence of these parameters, the specific effects that variations in concentration can achieve, and how the two crosslinking variables interact. The results demonstrate that there is substantial latitude in the design of these constructs by these straightforward crosslinking modifications. These data provide the basis for studying the in vivo response to crosslinking conditions that will supply the requisite strength while still allowing host cell infiltration and remodeling.},

Specifically, we discuss (1) the interactions of valve biology and biomechanics (eg, correlations of function with structure at the cell, tissue, and organ levels and mechanical considerations, development, endothelial cell and interstitial cell biology, extracellular matrix biology, homeostasis, and adaptation to environmental change); (2) mechanisms of disease (eg, valve cell and matrix pathobiology in congenital anomalies, aortic valve calcification, and mitral valve prolapse); (3) considerations in replacement and repair (eg, cell/matrix biology of tissue valve substitutes and their degeneration and durability of repairs); and (4) the potential for tissue engineering approaches to therapeutic regeneration of the cardiac valves. Opportunities for research and clinical translation are highlighted.},
