Simulation of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues is critical for many physiological and medical device applications, and rigorous analysis of mechanical test data is crucial for obtaining accurate estimates of constitutive model parameters. Proper analysis of biaxial mechanical test data, in particular, can be complicated by shearing, tissue heterogeneities, and  inelastic changes in specimen geometry due preconditioning and testing. These inelastic effects alter stress tensor components and, without appropriate corrections, the stress-to-traction mapping generally violates equilibrium. To overcome these problems, we propose a method to determine stresses in the Cauchy sense from the experimentally derived tractions accounting for the measured testing geometry, and to compensate for run-time inelastic effects by enforcing equilibrium using small rigid body rotations. To test the effectiveness of our method, we simulated the full planar biaxial test with the experiment device mechanisms and geometry using finite element (FE) technique. We found that our method corrects the errors in the equilibrium of momentum and offer significant improvement in the estimate of the shear stresses. We also learned that since stress is applied mostly over the region bounded by the tethers, there need to be an adjustment to the specimen dimensions to correct the magnitude of the stresses. The layout of the tether positions can also attribute to the errors in the stress calculated. However, typical suture placements used in real experiments are sufficiently accurate. Overall, our method provides an improved and relatively straightforward method of calculating the resulting stresses for planar biaxial experiments, which is especially useful for samples that undergo large shear and exhibit inelastic effects.
