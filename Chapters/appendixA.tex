Simulation of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues is critical for many physiological and medical device applications. Accurate mechanical test data is crucial for both obtaining the form and robust parameter determination of the constitutive model. For incompressible soft tissues that are either membranes or thin sections, planar biaxial mechanical testing configurations can provide much information about the anisotropic stressâ€“strain behavior. However, the analysis of soft biological tissue planar biaxial mechanical test data can be complicated by in-plane shear, tissue heterogeneities, and inelastic changes in specimen geometry that commonly occur during testing. These inelastic effects, without appropriate corrections, alter the stress-traction mapping and violates equilibrium so that the stress tensor is incorrectly determined. To overcome these problems, we presented an analytical method to determine the Cauchy stress tensor from the experimentally derived tractions for tethered testing configurations. We accounted for the measured testing geometry and compensate for run-time inelastic effects by enforcing equilibrium using small rigid body rotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we simulated complete planar biaxial test configurations that incorporated actual device mechanisms, specimen geometry, and heterogeneous tissue fibrous structure using a finite element (FE) model. We determined that our method corrected the errors in the equilibrium of momentum and correctly estimated the Cauchy stress tensor. We also noted that since stress is applied primarily over a subregion bounded by the tethers, an adjustment to the effective specimen dimensions is required to correct the magnitude of the stresses. Simulations of various tether placements demonstrated that typical tether placements used in the current experimental setups will produce accurate stress tensor estimates. Overall, our method provides an improved and relatively straightforward method of calculating the resulting stresses for planar biaxial experiments for tethered configurations, which is especially useful for specimens that undergo large shear and exhibit substantial inelastic effects.
