    Fundamental to developing a deeper understanding of soft tissue function and pathology is the development of an accurate tissue-level constitutive model. In the present work, we developed a novel meso-scale (i.e. at the level of the fiber, 10-100 $\mu$m in length scale) structural constitutive model (MSSCM) with application to MV leaflet and ovine pulmonary arterial tissues. This model takes into account the layered structure of these tissue and the contributions from the distinct collagen and elastin fiber networks within each tissue layer. Requisite collagen and elastin fibrous structural information for each layer were quantified using second harmonic generation microscopy and conventional histology. A comprehensive mechanical data set was also used to guide model formulation and parameter estimation. Furthermore, novel to tissue-level structural constitutive modeling approaches, we allowed the collagen fiber recruitment function to vary with orientation. Finally, a novel fibril-level (0.1 to 1 $\mu$m) validation approach was used to compare the predicted collagen fiber/fibril mechanical behavior with extant MV small angle X-ray scattering data. Results demonstrated excellent agreement, indicating that the MSSCM fully captures the tissue-level function. Future utilization of the MSSCM in computational models of the MV will aid in producing highly accurate simulations in non-physiological loading states that can occur in repair situations, as well as guide the form of simplified models for real-time simulation tools.
