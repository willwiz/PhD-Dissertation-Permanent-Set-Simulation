\item Stenosis is the hardening of the leaflets, more often than not, this is due to calcification of the leaflets. 
\item This can have significant impacts on the fluid dynamics through the valve, impacting the efficiency, stroke volume and other complications. 
\item Regurgitation on the other hand is the improper closure of the leaflets during systole. The are many possible cause. heart valve stenosis, heart valve regurgitation, Endocarditis, and genetic valve diseases (Bicuspid valve disease, quadricuspid valve diseases, etc.). 
\item 
\item Current treatments for Valvular diseases are highly invasive and have high mortality rates. 
\item Repair procedures are highly difficult but are still the preferred surgical procedure
\item Repair procedures are generally composed of annuloplasty 
\item The are many questions include the shape of the annulus and impact on the surrounding myocardium, root and arteries.
