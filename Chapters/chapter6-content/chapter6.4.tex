\section{Conclusions}
    We have developed a complete time-dependent framework for the simulation of BHVs under long-term cyclic loading. This simulation utilizes the predictive mechanism based constitutive model for the permanent set effect in exogenously crosslinked soft tissues that we previously developed. We have shown that we can use this simulation to predict the evolving geometry, microstructural and material property changes. These results can then be used to predict regions of increasing likelihood of structural damage and can be used to optimize the initial design of BHVs based on these factors. Most important of these effects is that the collagen fiber architecture can play a role in limiting the permanent set effect, where the straightening of collagen fibers prevents further changes in geometry. Thus, accounting for the permanent set effect is especially important in the design of BHVs to better improve their performance and durability.
