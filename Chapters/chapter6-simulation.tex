    AWT is currently the only way to evaluate BHV durability in a feasible amount of time (months instead of years). However, the loading conditions and environment during AWT are not physiological and the only durability information currently used is the presence of visible damage. Only the clinical evaluation stage can provide true indications of the \textit{in vivo} performance of BHV designs. However, this is the final, most difficult, most expensive and most time-consuming stage. Clearly, current methods of evaluating BHV designs are not feasible for advancing the BHV technology in a timely manner. In this chapter, we implement our constitutive model for the permanent set of BHVs developed in a previous chapter in a time-evolving numerical simulation framework using the effective constitutive model approach, and attempt to predict the geometric and structural change that occurs with the onset of permanent set.
