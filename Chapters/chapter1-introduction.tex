    Heart valves play a critical role of preventing back flow during cardiac operations. They are designed to withstand the demanding mechanical environment of the heart while maintaining optimal state for over 3 billion cycles. When they can no longer function properly due to fatigue, diseases or trauma, and surgical repair is not an option, surgical replacement using bioprosthetic heart valves is often the best choice. This introductory chapter focus on the current state of heart valve replacements and design, and methods for improving the durability of these devices. First, an overview of the structure and functions of heart valves is provided. Then the current state of heart valve repair and replacement is summarized, followed by the current state of bioprosthetic valve design and fabrication as well as they durability and limitations. Finally, the causes and mechanisms of bioprosthetic heart valve failure is discussed, and we outline the motivation, rationale and aims of this dissertation, on how constitutive modeling and simulations can be used to better understand bioprosthetic heart valve failure and facilitate the improvement of bioprosthetic heart valve design.
