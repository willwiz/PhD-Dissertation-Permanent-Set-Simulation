\section{Currently studies on the mechanical fatigue of bioprosthetic heart valves}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Bioprosthetic heart valve replacements cannot grow, remodel or self repair.
\item Current bioprosthetic heart valves are not patient specifically designed. 
\item Surgical success even after only sixth month can be hard to predict. 
\end{enumerate}
