\section{Additional results for other tissue types and effective constitutive model forms} \label{sec:otherresults}

	Bovine pericardium is a good soft tissue to start with due high axes stretch coupling from their broad fiber splays. However, soft tissue behavior is drastically different with greater degree and anisotropy. For example aortic valve leaflets have larger elastin content resulting in larger toe region and extremely narrow ODFs, which can cause contraction along the material axis under equi-biaxial tension \cite{billiar_biaxial_2000b}. This behavior is hard for most constitutive models to replicate. However, $\Psi_{eff}$ (Eqn. \ref{eqn:finalexponentialmodelformscaled}) has no problem replicating this behavior (Fig. \ref{fig:aorticfit}).

    Based on D-optimality, we determined the optimal loading paths and shown its importance for model predictability. The equi-biaxial stress loading path (near equi-biaxial) came out as especially important, as it is included in all sets of optimal loading paths except for two and four (Fig. \ref{fig:oddpaths}\&\ref{fig:evenpaths}). Commonly, when reproducing results from older publication, only the equi-biaxial stress loading path may be included in the figures as it is the most informative. Indeed, using the equi-biaxial stress loading paths simply results in much higher D-optimality than other choices. However, using this loading path alone is not sufficient for parameter estimation. Although the quality of fit is very good (Fig. \ref{fig:effequifit}A\&B), it cannot predict other loading paths (Fig. \ref{fig:effequifit}C\&D)

    With the addition of other loading paths, even non-optimal, this can significantly improve the predictive capabilities (Fig. \ref{fig:modelspred}A\&B). However, we can clearly see that because the loading paths are not optimal, the $0.1/1$ loading path is not predicted very well (Fig. \ref{fig:modelspred}B). We tested to see if this can be improved through more specific forms of $\Psi_{eff}$ (Eqn. \ref{eqn:finalexponentialmodelformscaled}). For this, we looked at an extension of the generalized Fung model to quadratic terms presented by Sun \textit{et al.} \cite{sun_biaxial_2003} to better fit the response of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine pericardium. The additional terms are only of cubic and quartic powers, $B_{ijkl}E_{ij}^2E_{kl}^2$. In comparison to $\Psi_{eff}$, this is only missing $E_m^3E_n$ and $E_m^3E_n$,

We will call this the extended Fung model. In addition, Sun \textit{et al.} \cite{sun_biaxial_2003} also recommended a more minimalistic form, where only the coupling term $2B_3E_{11}^2E_{22}^2$ is added as ,

%==========================================================% 
    We shall call this the Sun model. 

	Although the equality of fit are all equally as good \ref{fig:modelsfit}, the extended Fung model (Eqn. \ref{eqn:fullsunmodel}) predicts $S_{22}$ component of the 0.1/1 loading path much better, but predicts the wrong sign for $S_{11}$ for the same loading path, as well as predicting the 1/0.1 loading path worse (Fig. \ref{fig:modelspred}C\&D). The Sun model (Eqn. \ref{eqn:extendedfung}) on the other hand is similar to $\Psi_{eff}$ but worse at predicting $S_{11}$ of the 1/0.1 loading path (Fig. \ref{fig:modelspred}E\&F). It's hard to predict how these constitutive models will behave when the loading paths are not optimal. This is especially true when only a single protocol is used, where predictions for all other protocols can be very poor (Fig. \ref{fig:effequifit}). However, as little as three loading paths are needed to fully reproduce the mechanical response of soft tissue over the entire range of deformations (Fig. \ref{fig:effoptpred}).
