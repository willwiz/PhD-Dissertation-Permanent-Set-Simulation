\section*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}%

In this appendix, we cover some of the lose ends for the effective constitutive models (chapter 5) we developed and as well as some of the considerations and tests we have done that were not included in the main text. First we will look at the choice of kinematic variable and how they affect the constitutive model. They we will look at how this choice will affect the parameter correlations, stress and elasticity tensor forms, and thus how we arrived at the choice of Green-Lagrange strain for our effective constitutive model. We will also go into more detail about the optimal loading paths, how they develop as you are additional loading paths. Finally, we will go into a deeper look at the effect of changing the effective model form and loading paths of the ability of the model to fit and predict mechanical responses.
